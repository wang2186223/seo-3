                <p>Around noon, just as Kayla stepped outside, her eyes Landed on Liam&#39;s car idling by the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got out of the car, reached for her hand like nothing was amiss, and said, &#34;Let&#39;s go. I&#39;ll drive you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jerked her hand away and snapped, &#34;Stay away from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an indifferent shrug, he strolled to the front of the car and pulled open the passenger-side door.&#34;Suit yourself. Just get in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla bypassed him without a word, opened the back door, and slipped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the car rolled forward, Liam spoke. &#34;We&#39;re going to visit the Cooper family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot back, &#34;If you have something to say,handle it on your own. Why do I have to be involved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught her reflection in the rearview mirror.&#34;Haven&#39;t seen your dad in a while. Figured now&#39;s a good time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla scoffed, a flash of contempt flickering in her eyes. So now he was playing the dutiful son-in-law?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the car stopped in front of the Cooper family&#39;s place, the security guard checked the license plate and swung the gate open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Kayla and Liam walked through the door,Zoe&#39;s enraged voice rang out from upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glass of water came flying down, smashing against the floor just inches from Kayla&#39;s feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced upward and saw Amaya and Damon rushing toward the staircase, their expressions tight with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Liam took a step forward, his face painted with faux concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon, noticing Liam, quickly adopted a more attentive posture and stumbled down the stairs.&#34;Oh,it&#39;s nothing. Just an accident with Zoe. What brings the two of you here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla eyed the broken glass at her feet. Was it really an accident, or had it been deliberate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a while, so I thought I&#39;d drop by and bring some gifts for you.&#34; Liam held up several large bags,each overflowing with expensive items.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s face brightened, his eyes glimmering with interest. He grabbed Liam&#39;s arm and led him to the sofa. &#34;Have a seat. Let&#39;s relax with some coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,faint shouts from upstairs caught Kayla&#39;s attention. Amaya and Zoe were having a heated argument, though she couldn&#39;t make out the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Kayla, Damon said, &#34;Kayla, come join us.Why stand there like a statue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a short nod, Kayla made her way over to the。seating area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Zoe&#39;s fury was on full display as she angrily sliced through the fabric of a beautiful dress with a pair of scissors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amaya rushed in,yanked the scissors from Zoe&#39;s grasp,and snapped, &#34;What do you think you are doing? You spent days getting this dress ready, and now you&#39;re tearing it to shreds? All that effort for nothing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s hair hung in wild tangles, her eyes red and swollen. She shouted through her tears, &#34;What&#39;s the point in saving it? Jeremy didn&#39;t bother coming,So who exactly am I meant to impress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s ridiculous. He couldn&#39;t make it tonight, but that doesn&#39;t mean he won&#39;t come around later. I don&#39;t believe for a second that he plans to ignore you forever. What&#39;s got you so worked up?&#34; Amaya said,her voice tight with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe let out a piercing scream. &#34;I couldn&#39;t care less! He made a promise, then bailed with just one phone call.How am I supposed to marry him if this is how he treats me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amaya pulled her daughter into the room and clamped a hand over her mouth. &#34;Lower your voice!Kayla and her husband are right downstairs. If they hear this, it&#39;s over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s anger only deepened at the mention of Kayla.&#34;Why is she even here? Did she come just to gloat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it!&#34; Amaya raised her hand in frustration but faltered, unable to follow through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s voice cracked as she cried out, &#34;You&#39;re really going to hit me? I&#39;m the one he stood up. I&#39;m the one falling apart, and you want to hit me? Seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amaya let out a heavy sigh, lowered her arm, and said,&#34;Whatever brought Kayla and Liam here today doesn&#39;t matter right now. What matters is that you get it together and come downstairs. Liam may be useless,but he is still a Graham. Don&#39;t let a single word of this nonsense reach his ears.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned on her heel and exited the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still seething, Zoe snatched the pillows from her bed and hurled them out the open doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the living room below, Liam and Damon were deep in a lively conversation. To anyone watching, they could&#39;ve passed for a real father-son pair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla sat off to the side, focused on her phone,skimming through the team&#39;s group chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie had just dropped a round of cash gifts. Kayla joined in and managed to collect a few hundred bucks,a small victory that made her grin, she&#39;d treat herself to something good tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry for the wait. Zoe just came back from a day out with her friends and needed a minute to freshen up,&#34; Amaya said with a breezy laugh as she approached. She rested a hand lightly on Kayla&#39;s shoulder. &#34;It&#39;s been sometime. You&#39;ve slimmed down!I&#39;ll have the staff make something special for you later. You should eat more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Repulsed by her pretense, Kayla snapped, &#34;Get your hand off mne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amaya traded an uneasy glance with Damon,then gave a tight smile and pulled her hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to smooth things over, Damon said, &#34;Kayla, is that any way to speak to your stepmother? Where&#39;s your respect?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stepmother?&#34; Kayla scoffed under her breath,barely keeping herself from rolling her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam cleared his throat. &#34;Actually, we came today because of Zoe. My grandfather would like to meet her.&#34;</p>
