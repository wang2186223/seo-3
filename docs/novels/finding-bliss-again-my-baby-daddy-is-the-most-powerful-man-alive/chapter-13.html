                <p>Jeremny had a private villa in Blossom Estate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the living room, he lounged on the sofa, coffee in hand,his eyes fixed on the woman across from him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to hand over your shares in Perennia Group to me?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stepped closer, her voice firm but calm. &#34;Yes. If you agree to collaborate with Perennia Group, I&#39;ll transfer every share I own to you. You&#39;ll become the second-largest shareholder in the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the plan she&#39;d spent the night putting together</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleep had been impossible-she&#39;d tossed and turned until morning, waiting for the right moment to come and make her offer in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d worried she wouldn&#39;t be allowed in. It was his home, after all. But the butler had gone to ask, and surprisingly, Jeremy had agreed to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft scoff escaped him. Not quite amused-more like he was entertained by her nerve. &#34;Perennia Group is barely a blip. It&#39;s not even worth a third of North Investment&#39;s value Why would I want your shares?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whether they&#39;re valuable or not-you&#39;d know that better than anyone,&#34; Kayla answered, her voice laced with careful ambiguity</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s gaze sharpened, ice replacing the mockery &#34;Does Liam know about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re my shares,&#34; she said, lifting her chin slightly &#34;I don&#39;t need his permission to use them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you two always joined at the hip? Did you fight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla pressed her lips into a thin line,clearly unwilling to delve into her private life Without missing a beat,she steered the conversation elsewhere</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry about yesterday I made some soup this morning to apologize. I hope you&#39;ll accept it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed a thermos on the table</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You made it?&#34; Jeremy raised a brow, suddenly interested</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Kayla said, her lashes fluttering nervously</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course she hadn&#39;t The housekeeper had prepared the soup that morning,but the moment Kayla caught its scent, her stomach turned. Still, she decided to bring it along-Jeremy wouldn&#39;t be able to tell she hadn&#39;t made it herself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say anything,leaving her uncertain. Was he considering the offer? Or just humoring her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Graham, you have a guest,&#34; the maid announced.Almost on cue, Zoe appeared in the doorway</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla turned to her, eyes narrowing just slightly. Of all times,she had to show up now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Graham!&#34; Zoe&#39;s voice rang brightly as she moved straight to him, dressed like she had comne to make an impression. But when her eyes landed on Kayla, her expression soured. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t bother replying. She looked away,unimpressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s face stiffened from the lack of attention and leaned in toward Jeremy. &#34;How&#39;s your injury?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His posture eased a bit. &#34;Much better,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe lit up, practically beaming. She reached into her bag and set down a thermos too. &#34;I was worried, sSO I made some soup and brought it over. I hope it helps you feel better.&#34; Edwin, nearby couldn&#39;t help the thought that crossed his mind-the Cooper sisters sure were diligent Both of them, showing up with soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s gaze flicked to the first thermos already on the table. She realized instantly it was from Kayla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still smiling, she gently pushed Kayla&#39;s thermos to the side and said sweetly. &#34;Oh, Kayla brought soup too?If I&#39;d known you were coming, we could&#39;ve come together. That way, we wouldn&#39;t bother you twice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla remained quiet, refusing to entertain Zoe&#39;s fake friendliness</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she couldn&#39;t ignore the shift in Jeremy&#39;s demeanor whenever Zoe spoke. Did he really think she was the woman from that night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could dwell on it, a servant entered with a tray of fresh fruit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe immediately offered, &#34;Mr. Graham, let me peel an apple for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t answer, but she picked up an apple and started peeling it anyway. Once done,she handed it to him with both hands</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy wasn&#39;t one to eat food others had touched,but he accepted it this time &#34;Thank you.&#34; &#34;You&#39;re welcome!&#34; Zoe beamed like a child who&#39;d won a prize</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was convinced now-Jeremy liked her Definitely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to prove her magnanimity, she grabbed another apple and held it out toward Kayla &#34;Kayla, would you like one too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent hit Kayla instantly Her stomach turned. She quickly covered her mouth, turning her face to the side,quietly gagging</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy noticed His eyes flicked up to her, watching carefully</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s reaction was immediate and dramatic. &#34;Kayla,are you pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s heart skipped a beat, but she didn&#39;t flinch Instead, she replied calmly, &#34;I&#39;ve had a few stomach issues lately. I&#39;m on medication. But, Zoe, you&#39;ve never shown much concern for me before. Why now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Zoe&#39;s face cracked. She turned quickly to Jeremy,hoping he&#39;d say something,maybe defend her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he simply said, &#34;You should leave. We still have matters to discuss&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe stood frozen for a beat, then forced a tight smile &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll visit you again soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked past Kayla, she shot her a sharp glare before disappearing out the door</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the room quiet again, Kayla turned back to Jeremy. &#34;I&#39;ve already passed the project files to your assistant. It&#39;s a real estate venture-its value will only go up. If you decide to move forward, it&#39;ll be a strong strategic play I hope you&#39;ll consider it. And if you change your mind, you can reach out anytime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t respond, and Kayla knew staying any longer would be pointless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small nod, then turned and walked out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cool air hit her the moment she stepped outside,and she finally let herself exhale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming here had been a risk. She didn&#39;t know if Jeremy would see the value in her offer</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her marriage to Liam had been brief, she&#39;d picked up enough during Graham family gatherings to piece together a few unsettling truths</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s mother had died, and all the whispers all pointed to Janiya Graham-Liam&#39;s mother Janiya was Johnny&#39;s illegitimate daughter Years ago,Johnny&#39;s affair had driven Jeremy&#39;s mother to the brink She fell ill and eventually died Later, Johnny brought Janiya home</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy had never forgiven that Janiya had spent years trying to push Liam back into the family business,maneuvering to give him a top seat in Graham Group</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy wouldn&#39;t let it happen. If anything, he was likely working to dismantle her plans-starting with Liam&#39;s Perennia Group</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla had connected the dots just last night. That was when she made her decision</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shares, backed by the fact that she&#39;d funded most of Perennia&#39;s early development, made up a full third of the company</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the choice rested with Jeremy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Kayla stepped off the front steps, she stopped short. Zoe was waiting for her outside</p>
