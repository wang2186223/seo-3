                <p>Kayla Graham was pregnant, but the child wasn&#39;t her husband&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped out of the consultation room, her hands shaking as she held the pregnancy test results. Her legs felt unsteady, and her mind hadn&#39;t caught up with the shock that had just hit her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a month ago, she had tied the knot with her boyfriend of five years. But on their wedding night,she found out he&#39;d been cheating-his phone was loaded with intimate pictures of him and another woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Devastated, she drowned her pain in alcohol, and in her haze, she stumbled into the wrong hotel room,waking up the next morning beside a man she didn&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, she hadn&#39;t gotten a clear look at his face -only the memory of his overpowering presence,nearly suffocating, and the vast room that seemed to swallow her whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the morning, too ashamed to stay, she slipped out in silence, never looking back. She never could have imagined that a single reckless night would leave her carrying that man&#39;s child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla had no idea what to do-restless, anxious, and overwhelmed.She was desperate to find a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed just then, snapping her back. A message from her husband, Liam Graham.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, I&#39;m outside the hospital,waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring blankly at the screen, she slid the phone back into her pocket and moved toward the elevator without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For days, the nausea and dizziness had lingered. When she could no longer brush it off, she finally went to the hospital, only to be blindsided by the news of her pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Kayla stepped out of the hospital, the first thing she saw was Liam&#39;s black car waiting by the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a breath, she hurried toward the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam got out of the car and walked around to open her door. He looked even more striking and refined in his crisp black suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did the doctor say?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a stomach upset,&#34; she said, voice flat. &#34;You&#39;ve always had a thing for spicy food. You&#39;ll need to ease up. It&#39;s not good for your stomach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave a slight nod The moment she slid into the car, a subtle trace of flowery perfume for women hit her. Liam never used air fresheners-he hated them.That scent could only mean one thing: another woman had been here</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam reached over and gently ruffled her hair. &#34;I&#39;ll take you home so you can get some rest. I need to return to the office for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; she mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the car waited at a red light, Liam answered an incoming call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shifted slightly and felt her hand graze against something soft. She reached down and pulled out a pink silk scarf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed, fixed on the scarf-it looked far too familiar to be a coincidence. She had once seen the scarf in one of the pictures on his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Liam hung up, he turned with a warm smile.&#34;Kayla, I&#39;lI drop you off first, then I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She interrupted him, raising the scarf. Her voice was sharp and firm. &#34;Who does this belong to?&#34; Liam&#39;s eyes flashed with a hint of panic, but he covered it up with a strained chuckle. &#34;Must be from a client earlier today. I&#39;ll return it tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for the scarf,but Kayla yanked it back and said defiantly, &#34;Liam, I want a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam threw back his head in disbelief. &#34;Kayla, it&#39;s just a scarf! Why are you blowing this out of proportion?You can&#39;t throw the word &#39;divorce&#39; around like it means nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave a cold, humorless laugh. &#34;How much longer were you going to keep lying? You left me on our wedding night for her,didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam stared at her, stunned, a rare disoriented look in his eyes. &#34;It was a last-minute meeting. You&#39;ve got it all wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla had no interest in hearing his excuses.He had betrayed her, and now she carried another man&#39;s child.Their marriage was beyond saving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Out of respect for the years we&#39;ve shared, let&#39;s end this peacefully,&#34; she said, her tone icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, she pushed open the door and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam sat motionless behind the wheel, his fingers  clenched so tightly they turned white. Then, with a furious roar,he slammed his fist against the steering wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla took a taxi home. As she stepped into the living room， her eyes landed on their wedding photo一framed perfectly at the center, the two of them beaming with joy. Now, the image struck her as bitterly ironic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the night of their wedding, she had seen explicit images of Liam with Tricia Moss, tangled in compromising poses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single blow had shattered everything. Five years of loyalty had meant nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla dropped to her knees, hands pressed tightly to her chest as the anguish she&#39;d bottled up came crashing out in a flood of raw emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears spilled freely, refusing to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know how much time had passed before her sobs finally quieted. All she knew was the emptiness that followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam arrived home late that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla lay still in the bed, facing away. When he pressed against her back, she didn&#39;t flínch. Instead, she shut her eyes His skin carried the chill of the night as he wrapped his arm around her over the blanket. &#34;Let&#39;s stop fighting,Kayla. I&#39;m sorry for earlier. It won&#39;t happen again.I love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted, pulling away from his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam let out a low chuckle, his voice smooth, almost teasing. He undressed quickly and slid toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s have sex tonight. Your period should be over by now,right?&#34;</p>
