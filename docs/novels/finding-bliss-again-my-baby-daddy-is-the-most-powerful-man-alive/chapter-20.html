                <p>Kayla lifted her hand to block the glare of the oncoming headlights. The car came to a sudden stop just a few feet away,barely missing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The window rolled down, and the driver leaned out,surprise written across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her hand and looked up-just in time to see the rear window slowly sliding down</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside sat a man, upright and composed, with an air of cold authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jeremy?&#34; Kayla went stiff for a moment, then quickly ran up to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s face darkened, and he growled, &#34;Are you trying to get yourself killed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had walked right into traffic. With cars whizzing past, it was like she didn&#39;t even care about her safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kayla didn&#39;t have time to respond to his scolding.As she gripped the car window with both hands,her eyes shimmered with tears. Before she could get a word out, Jeremy frowned &#34;What happened? Why do you look like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My grandma is missing Please help me find her,&#34;Kayla said,her voice shaky and tight with panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy had power and reach across all of Trark. If anyone could help, it was him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m begging you. Please help me find her.&#34; She couldn&#39;t stop herself from begging, her voice shaking with desperation</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t hesitate. He pulled out his phone and made a call &#34;I need to find someone... Now&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the other end responded immediately</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy pushed open the car door, ready to let her in,but before she could move, Kayla suddenly swayed and collapsed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught her just in time, his arm wrapping around her waist as her knees buckled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaylal&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face had gone pale, her eyes shut tight</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, he lifted her into the car and ordered the driver, &#34;To the hospital. Now.&#34; At the hospital, the faint sting of disinfectant and rubbing alcohol pulled Kayla from unconsciousness Sensitive to the sharp scent, she stirred awake in a rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her eyes fluttered open, she saw a doctor walking over with a stethoscope, about to begin an exam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frantic, Kayla jerked back and pushed him away before quickly sitting up. &#34;&#39;I&#39;m fine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor stumbled slightly, caught off guard by her reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy stepped forward, his voice firm and calm. &#34;Lie down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s heart pounded as she clutched the edge of her dress. &#34;I&#39;m okay. I just felt a bit lightheaded earlier.That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t risk a checkup. If they examined her,they&#39;d find out she was pregnant-and that couldn&#39;t happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy wasn&#39;t moved. &#34;You&#39;re already here. Just get examined properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need, really. I feel better now.&#34; Gathering what little courage she had, Kayla stepped toward him and grabbed his arm, trying to pull him toward the door. &#34;Please. Let&#39;s go find my grandma. We&#39;re wasting time &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy looked at her calmly. &#34;Your grandma&#39;s already been found.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; She froze, her grip tightening on his arm without thinking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy glanced down at her hand. &#34;How long are you planning to cling to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to!&#34; Kayla muttered, flustered,and quickly let go. &#34;Where is my grandma now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy adjusted his sleeve, smoothing out the creases, then replied casually, &#34;She was found outside a market. My people already sent her back to the care facility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relieved, Kayla exhaled slowly. Her eyes shimmered with gratitude as she looked up at him. &#34;Thank you SO much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just repaying the favor. You did save Zane&#39;s kid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, he turned and walked off with his assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stared at his back as he walked away, still frozen in place, lost in a daze she couldn&#39;t shake.</p>
