                <p>Liam felt the sting burning against his cheek. Kayla threw open the car door and stepped out without a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tightened his jaw. &#34;You sure about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shot him a glare, her voice cold. &#34;Just get lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, Liam slammed the gas pedal and sped off, tires screeching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone by the roadside, Kayla suddenly doubled over as a sharp pain stabbed her stomnach. She crouched down, clutching her abdomen, breath shallow with agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the rearview mirror, Liam caught a glimpse of her pained expression. He scoffed, assuming it was a ploy to guilt-trip him. His anger flared.&#34;Kayla, quit trying to get under my skin,&#34; he muttered,pressing harder on the gas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the back seat, Tricia watched the drama with a smirk. Once they were far enough away, she chimed in,&#34;This is in the middle of nowhere. Forecast says a big storm&#39;s rolling in. You sure it&#39;s okay to leave Kayla out there by herself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car disappeared around a bend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of lightning lit up the sky, followed by a deafening boom of thunder. Then the rain came, torrential and unrelenting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stood soaked and shivering on the empty road, with no shelter in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few cars zipped past, none slowing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, whatever lingering affection she&#39;d had for Liam vanished. Then, headlights pierced the downpour, blinding her. She raised her hand to shield her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek car pulled up beside her. The window rolled down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the downpour, she saw a strikingly handsome man, his features sharp even in the dim light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get in,&#34; Jeremy said coolly from the back seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain was falling too hard for hesitation. Kayla climbed in without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warm air from the car&#39;s heater wrapped around her like a blanket, melting the chill in her bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the passenger seat, Edwin turned and handed her a towel. &#34;Please, dry off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; Kayla replied, dabbing her wet hair carefully, not wanting to drip on the upholstery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy sat silently beside her, his presence intense and charged with something unspoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Kayla spoke softly. &#34;Thank you for letting me in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy looked over at her. &#34;Liam really left you out there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla nodded and turned to the window. The road they were on led straight to the Cooper family&#39;s estate.Jeremy must&#39;ve just dropped Zoe off; or he wouldn&#39;t have been passing through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you drop me at the next intersection? I&#39;ll wait out the rain and call an Uber,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t respond. When she glanced at him, his eyes were closed-either resting or asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin&#39;s phone buzzed. He took the call, then turned to Jeremy.&#34;Sir, there&#39;s been a landslide ahead. The road&#39;s blocked. We&#39;ll need to wait it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy opened his eyes, unfazed. &#34;Find a hotęl nearby. We&#39;ll stay the night and head back once the road&#39;s clear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They pulled into a nearby hotel, where Edwin went inside to check in. He returned a few minutes later with a keycard.′′MrA.Graham, your room&#39;s ready, but...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what?&#34; Jeremy asked, raising an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin looked at Kayla with a hint of regret. &#34;The road closure brought a crowd. All other rooms are taken.I couldn&#39;t get one for Kayla.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shrugged. &#34;It&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll call an Uber and take a different route.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy interjected, &#34;No one&#39;s coming out in this weather. Unless you&#39;re planning on hiking, that&#39;s not happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla fell silent. Walking wasn&#39;t an option. But staying?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s space in my room,&#34; Jeremy said, already moving toward the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla froze.His room?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin smirked as he leaned toward her. &#34;Most people would kill for a chance to bunk with Mr. Graham.Count yourself lucky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s stomach twisted. Sharing a room with Jeremy? That felt dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed them hesitantly. But when they entered a two-bedroom suite, she exhaled in quiet relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Discreetly, she wiped sweat from her brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy turned to her, voice smooth and teasing.&#34;You look nervous. What, thought I&#39;d make you share a bed?&#34;</p>
