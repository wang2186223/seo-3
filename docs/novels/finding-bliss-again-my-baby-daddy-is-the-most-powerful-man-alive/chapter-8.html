                <p>Outside on the terrace, Jeremy leaned against the railing, his stillness suggesting he&#39;d been expecting Kayla</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you suddenly hovering around me today?What&#39;s going on?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s lips curled into a sweet smile. &#34;I just saw you standing here and thought I&#39;d stop by to say hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is your final opportunity. Don&#39;t throw it away.&#34;There was a sharpness in his voice now, and the faint trace of irritation flickered across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s smile wavered for just a moment. Stepping forward,she reached into her bag and pulled out a folder. &#34;This is the project proposal for Perennia Group. I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll take another look and give us a second chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was her realreason for coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t spare the folder a single glance. His sharp nose and defined features gave him a cold,distant look, while his eyes held a blend of calm detachment and authority. A small firm-what reason do I have to partner with Liam? I&#39;m not running a charity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then consider it a favor. One small move from you could save a company and earn you a powerful ally,&#34;she pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s quiet chuckle carried a faint edge of contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned, eyes narrowing as he gave her a long,cutting once-over. &#34;Did Liam put you up to this?Sending a woman to do business-he&#39;s turning that general manager title into a joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I came of my own accord. I intend to win this project myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Edwin approached with a brisk stride. &#34;Mr.Graham, the office called. There&#39;s a situation that needs your attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t respond to her. Without a backward glance,he walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla started to go after him, but Edwin stepped into her path. &#34;Ma&#39;am,please control yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could only stand still and watch them disappear down the corridor. But she wasn&#39;t giving up. Jeremy would come around -she&#39;d make sure of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she turned to leave, a sharp, female voice rang out behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, what were you doing in the private room just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced up to find Zoe approaching,wearing an elegant designer dress, a high-end handbag swinging confidently at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla met Zoe&#39;s smug look with a frosty stare. &#34;Is this your property? What I do here doesn&#39;t concern you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s lips twisted into a smirk. &#34;Maybe not, but dragging the Cooper name through the mud in public isn&#39;t something I can ignore. Does Liam even know you&#39;re out tonight? You think you belong anywhere near Jeremy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave a quiet, contemptuous laugh. &#34;Jeremy is my husband&#39;s uncle. Sharing a meal with him isn&#39;t exactly scandalous. Meanwhile, you&#39;re the one skulking around, desperate for his approval&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Zoe tilted her chin, tapping the jeweled brooch pinned proudly to her chest. &#34;And what if l am?Jeremy has been searching for the woman who owns this brooch. Other than you, I&#39;m the only one with it You&#39;re married now, which means I&#39;m the only candidate left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s eyes narrowed with quiet intensity Her suspicions were confirmed-Jeremy really was looking for someone based on the brooch she&#39;d once lost</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman like Zoe wouldn&#39;t waste asecond exploiting an opportunity to climb higher</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Kayla couldn&#39;t risk confronting her without exposing herself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Kayla weighed her options, Zoe pulled a document from her bag and tossed it in her face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the way,you should know-Dad&#39;s decided to stop covering your grandmother&#39;s medical fees. You&#39;ll have to take care of it yourself. Since you&#39;re running Cooper Group nowv, it&#39;s not our responsibility anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla said in a cold, lethal voice, &#34;You guys caused my grandmother&#39;s fall and her dementia. Only a year has passed, and you think you can just walk away from it?That&#39;s not going to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe scoffed, eyes burning with defiance. &#34;Take it up with Dad if you&#39;re so upset. You think marrying Liam makes you someone important? Without the Cooper family&#39;s support, he would still be nobody. Jeremy is the true head of the Graham family. Once I marry him,you&#39;ll be answering to me.&#34; &#34;Save that talk for when you&#39;ve actually married Jeremy.&#34; Without looking back, Kayla walked off</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her, Zoe stomped the floor in frustration and yelled,&#34;Kayla, watch and see!&#34;</p>
