                <p>In his office, Liam was buried in paperwork when the sound of the door creaking open drew his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking up, he asked, &#34;Did you get a hold of Campbell Group&#39;s project lead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Graham, Tricia is in the lounge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam raised his head to see Felicia standing in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow furrowed. &#34;Did she finish her task? Why is she in the lounge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felicia shifted awkwardly, clearly conflicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak,&#34; Liam ordered, his voice sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Felicia said, &#34;We ran into your wife downstairs at the cafe. She seemed upset with Tricia.She threw coffee on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam didn&#39;t wait for more. He strode out, heading straight for the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Tricia was trying to clean herself up, blotting at the coffee stains on her white blouse.Her shirt was slightly open, black lace peeking out beneath the fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Liam entered, his eyes were drawn to the skin exposed beneath the drenched shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He loosened his tie and took a breath to suppress the heat rising in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia quickly turned her back, tugging her shirt closed. Her voice trembled with barely held tears.′′Mr.Graham,why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ignored her question. &#34;Did you see Kayla?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34; e some issues with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam stepped closer, taking in her disheveled appearance-her damp hair, smudged makeup, and the large coffee stain on her white shirt. &#34;Was this her doing?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in Tricia&#39;s eyes, though she tried to appear strong. &#34;She accused me of seducing you and even called you a scumbag. I understand if she doesn&#39;t like me. It&#39;s fine; I&#39;ll keep my distance from her in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oddly enough, Liam felt a trace of satisfaction stir in his chest. If Kayla was so angry-angry enough to lash out and throw coffee at Tricia-then that must mean she still cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still loved him. The thought eased some of the frustration that had been festering within him lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next time, don&#39;t provoke her. Stay out of her way.Understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia kept her gaze down, hiding the resentment in her eyes. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He removed his jacket and draped it over her shoulders. &#34;Go home and rest. Come back tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to leave, but shé caught his wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was soft, trembling with desperation. &#34;The power and water are out at my apartment. May I stay at your place tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam paused, torn. He wanted to refuse, but Kayla hadn&#39;t been home in days. She&#39;d clearly moved out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just one night. It wouldn&#39;t hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come to my office later. I&#39;ll give you the key.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia&#39;s face lit up. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the care facility, Kayla had just finished a walk with Marsha when her phone rang. It was Archie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, have you made your decision?&#34; he asked. Kayla helped Marsha settle at the table before answering, &#34;I have one condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie was unfazed. &#34;I&#39;m listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced back at her grandmother and lowered her voice. &#34;Give me one month. Pl land the projects you&#39;re targeting.If I succeed, I want Cooper Group returned to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief pause. &#34;You&#39;re saying you&#39;ll only work for a month?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My grandmother&#39;s health is deteriorating. I can&#39;t commit long-term. Call this a trial.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence, Archie agreed. &#34;Deal. After one month, the choice will be yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla returned to Marsha, who was watching her curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, why hasn&#39;t Liam come by lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with her fading memory, Marsha still remembered Liam&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s face stayed composed. &#34;He&#39;s been busy. But I&#39;ll be here from now on.I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, Kayla visited Newton Group to sign her contract. By the time everything was finalized,it was nearly noon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie handed her an envelope. &#34;We&#39;re hosting a business gala tonight. It&#39;ll be a good chance for you to get to know our network.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla accepted the invitation with a polite nod. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evening came quickly. The venue buzzed with industry elites, all dressed to impress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla kept her look simple-a blue evening gown, soft curls, and modest heels. Archie&#39;s car dropped her off at the front entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she stepped out, she saw Jeremy and Dewitt arriving together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie exchanged polite nods with Jeremy. As business partners, they kept things civil. Kayla, however, instinctively shifted behind Archie, hoping to avoid Jeremy&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jeremy didn&#39;t so much as glance at her. He walked past without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt, of course, noticed everything. He grinned, eyes gleaming with mischief. &#34;I didn&#39;t expect you to be Archie&#39;s date tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie answered coolly, &#34;Kayla has joined Newton Group. She&#39;s part of the team now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Dewitt said, his gaze lingering on Kayla a little too long before following Jeremy inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla felt her stomach twist. Dewitt&#39;s look had been loaded-curióus, amused, maybe even speculative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie gently prompted, &#34;Shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and followed him in, lifting the hem of her dress as they entered the grand ballroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Dewitt leaned close to Jeremy. &#34;Your nephew&#39;s wife is working for Archie now. Looks like she&#39;s serious about cutting ties with Liam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s eyes briefly followed Kayla&#39;s figure-poised, elegant, completely untouchable. His voice was flat.&#34;What does that have to do with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt chuckled, clapping him on the shoulder. &#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious? This is your chance to steal her for yourself.&#34;</p>
