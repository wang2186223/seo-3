                <p>Once the storm passed, the weather began to improve, and repairs soon began on the road that had been damaged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy instructed Edwin to drive Kayla home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arriving, she got out of the car, waving Edwin off as his black car eased into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Kayla turned to go inside, Liam appeared from the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His glare was sharp, almost predatory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla acted as if he weren&#39;t there and strode quickly toward the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam moved in front of her, blocking the door with a stiff arm and snapping, &#34;Who dropped you off? Where were you last night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stopped and gave him an icy look. &#34;Since when do I owe you explanations? You didn&#39;t hear me asking who kept you company last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The anger simmering in Liam finally spilled over. He jabbed a finger in her direction, his voice rising.&#34;I know you&#39;re seeing someone. You ignored my calls and vanished for hours. Just remember-you&#39;re still my wife.Don&#39;t make me lose it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s ridiculous,&#34; Kayla said with a sudden burst of laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her radiant smile lit up her face, effortlessly captivating anyone who saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam stood there, flustered and humiliated, yet unable to release the frustration boiling inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s so damn funny?&#34; he barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla turned to him, her expression flat and unfeeling. &#34;Liam, the moment you left me alone last night,we&#39;re done. Just be reasonable and handle the divorce paperwork. You&#39;re impossible to deal with.&#34; &#34;Kayla,how dare you speak to me like that!&#34; Liam snapped, his fury boiling over as he lifted his hand to strike her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t flinch. Her stare held steady, daring him to go through with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam hesitated, his arm frozen in the air, then slowly lowered it, seething. &#34;Don&#39;t test me, Kayla. You won&#39;t like where that leads.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla brushed past him, her expression blank, each step carrying the weight of resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furious, Liam lashed out, slamming his foot into a flowerpot and watching it topple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at home, Kayla changed outfits and left for Newton Group.Unwilling to give up, Liam tailed her car and parked outside the building like a shadow that wouldn&#39;t leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie&#39;s assistant approached her with a raised brow. &#34;Kayla, isn&#39;t that your husband&#39;s car?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stepped up to the window, her eyes landing on the car idling quietly by the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned back and said, &#34;Tell security to remove him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s been warned multiple times, but he wouldn&#39;t listen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration churned inside Kayla. Liam was being utterly disgraceful, disturbing her work without shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll speak to him myself,&#34; she muttered, heading for the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla.&#34; Archie&#39;s voice came from behind as he exited his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused and gave him a polite nod.&#34;Mr.Newton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having concluded the meeting, Archie dismissed the team and walked over to her. &#34;What&#39;s the rush?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bother to sugarcoat it. &#34;There&#39;s someone downstairs causing a scene. I need to get rid of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie wasn&#39;t clueless; he had a good idea of who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened his tie with a calm hand and gave a nod. &#34;Focus on your tasks. I&#39;ll arrange for someone to take care of everything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla offered a sincere nod of appreciation. &#34;Thank you, Mr. Newton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the building, Liam&#39;s car sat amidst a mess of cigarette butts, but he remained unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned against the window, eyes locked on the building, still reeling from the shock that Kayla had actually landed a job here-and somehow even caught Archie&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden burst of water struck his face, making him flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spotted two security guards spraying the pavement with hoses and quickly stepped out of the car to confront them. &#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the guards answered evenly,&#34;Sir, we&#39;re just clearing the trash from the street.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s expression soured. Were they calling him trash?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked to the badges on their uniforms-Newton Group. He realized immediately that they wouldn&#39;t dare pull this stunt without backing from higher-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly changed his approach. &#34;I&#39;d like a word with Mr. Newton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Newton is currently occupied. Please schedule an appointment. If you don&#39;t move your vehicle, we&#39;ll have it towed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humiliated but unwilling to create a public scene, Liam climbed back into the car and drove off in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From an upper floor, Kayla watched the car disappear down the street, the tension in her brow slowly easing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and rapped gently on the CEO&#39;s office door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in.&#34; Archie glanced up from the stack of files as she walked toward his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liam&#39;s gone. Thank you, Mr. Newton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a curt nod. &#34;Get ready-we&#39;re heading to North Investment for a meeting.&#34; Kayla hesitated before speaking. &#34;Mr. Newton, wouId it be possible for someone else to attend in my place?&#34;</p>
