                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t waver as she replied,&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s face tightened with frustration. &#34;So you&#39;re not open to discussion at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from her seat, Kayla fixed him with a cold,unwavering stare. &#34;We&#39;re going through the divorce,Liam. If I reclaim Cooper Group by myself, you&#39;ll be left with nothing to negotiate.&#34; Without waiting for his reaction, she turned on her heel and strode off,not once looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Liam could do was watch as she slipped into a cab and vanished down the street. He stayed rooted in place,hands clenched so tightly his knuckles whitened.&#34;I&#39;ve swallowed my pride this far. Why won&#39;t she relent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness soon crept over the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By dinnertime, Marsha had recovered a bit of her warmth and reached over, squeezing Kayla&#39;s hand in a gentle, affectionate gesture. &#34;Kayla, are you really divorcing Liam? He&#39;s been running himself ragged these days, doing everything he can to help me. He really is a good man at heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla slowly stirred her pasta, her expression unreadable. &#34;Grandma, I&#39;ve explained this before. Liam isn&#39;t who he once was. Everything he does now is calculated-he&#39;s just trying to manipulate me for his own benefit. I&#39;m not the naive girl he fooled all those years ago. That version of me is gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha&#39;s intentions were always kind. She still clung to the belief that love alone could heal any wound.&#34;Sweetheart, even if Liam made some mistakes, he&#39;s working hard to make up for them. Doesn&#39;t that count for something? Maybe you could find it in your heart to forgive him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting her fork down with a quiet clink, Kayla met Marsha&#39;s gaze, her eyes shadowed but unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t hard to piece together what had happened.Liam had probably been feeding Marsha every excuse he could invent while she was not around. Now, every word out of Marsha&#39;s mouth sounded like she was reading straight from his script.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only one thought crossed Kayla&#39;s mind-Liam really was something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open, and the new caregiver entered,arms full of oversized pots brimming with vibrant flowers. &#34;Ma&#39;am, these just arrived from overseas. Mr.Graham said you&#39;d appreciate having something fresh to tend to, since you&#39;ve been cooped up indoors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha&#39;s eyes went wide with delight. &#34;Liam! He never forgets about me. He knew I&#39;d feel restless and sent flowers to cheer me up. How thoughtful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The careqiver offered a quick smnile. &#34;That&#39;s not all- there are quite a few other gifts waiting, too. Once you&#39;re finished with dinner, you might want to see for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha beamed, clasping her hands together. &#34;How wonderful! I&#39;ll have a look as soon as we&#39;re done eating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla sat through their conversation, every bite of her food growing more bland with each word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single realization crystallized in her mind-if she wanted this divorce finalized, Marsha needed to witness the truth about Liam for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening at the Grand Court Hotel, Zoe had pulled out all the stops. She stepped into the lobby draped in a striking crimson gown, her hair cascading in flawless waves, and a team of stylists had perfected every detail of her makeup. She radiated elegance, looking every bit like she was about to command the runway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perched in the luxurious private dining room,she fidgeted with her compact mirror, anxiously touching up her makeup as she waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice called from the hallway, &#34;Mr. Graham has arrived.&#34; That single announcement sent a rush of adrenaline through her. She sprang to her feet,smoothing her dress as she struggled to tamp down her excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy entered, his deep purple shirt neatly tucked into impeccably tailored black slacks. Every movement radiated self-assurance, an easy authority filling the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe moved closer, her gaze dropping shyly as she greeted him. &#34;Jeremy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A waiter pulled out the chair with a practiced flourish,and Jeremy took his seat with composed elegance.&#34;Hope I didn&#39;t keep you waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe slipped into the chair beside him, flashing a warm,eager smile. &#34;Not at all. I only just arrived myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze swept over the table, taking in the parade of luxurious dishes arranged like works of art. The sheer extravagance hardly registered anymore; he&#39;d long since grown indifferent to this kind of opulence.&#34;All this for just the two of us? Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a bit over the top?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe quickly reached for a fork and transferred a delicate portion onto his plate. &#34;Please, give it a try.These are the chef&#39;s specialties. My parents have dined here before, and they raved about every dish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having grown up on lavish meals like these, Jeremy knew each flavor by heart. No matter the price or presentation, it all blurred together on his palate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, he didn&#39;t protest and reached for a fork, his every movement unhurried and refined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A delighted gleam danced in Zoe&#39;s eyes as she gazed at him. &#34;Please, help yourself. If this isn&#39;t enough, I&#39;ll call for more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy paused, fork in hand, then gently nudged several meat-laden plates in her direction. &#34;You should eat something,too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe shook her head with a quick, dismissive gesture.&#34;I&#39;m not hungry, really. You enjoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been rigidly restricting her diet for weeks now,steering clear of anything oily or carb-heavy-no matter how much she secretly craved it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy glanced at her untouched plate, his tone mild but unmistakable. &#34;In that case, don&#39;t go overboard with the ordering next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, several waiters arrived, moving about the room as they set up instruments and adjusted the space for an impromptu performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced poise, Zoe rose from her seat. &#34;I&#39;ve been working on a new dance. Would you like to see it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy offered a short nod. &#34;If you&#39;re in the mood to perform,go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe stepped into the center of the room and gestured for the staff to clear out. In moments, the two of them were alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confidence radiated from her with every breath;tonight, she intended to win Jeremy over for good. When the music swelled, Zoe lifted herself gracefully onto her toes, launching into the choreography she&#39;d rehearsed for weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each step flowed seamlessly into the next, her arms curving elegantly through the air, but to Jeremy, the whole performance felt empty-beautiful on the surface yet utterly devoid of warmth. He watched in silence, his expression unreadable, until his attention started to drift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absentmindedly, he picked up his phone, scrolling through notifications with a lazy flick of his thumb.A flash of color on his screen made him pause-a new update from Kayla had just appeared.</p>
