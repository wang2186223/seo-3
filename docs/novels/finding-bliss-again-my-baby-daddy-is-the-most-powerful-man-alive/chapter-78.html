                <p>Kayla&#39;s dream felt so real it left her breathless. In it,Jeremy held her tightly from behind, pinning her to the bed. His lips brushed across her skin, warm and slow,drawing startled gasps from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the sex was over, he cradled her against his chest. His large hands gripped her waist like he could snap her in two if he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned close, voice low and charged. &#34;You&#39;ve got some nerve,lying to me all this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla bolted upright in bed with a cry, her eyes wide open. Sunlight streamed in through the window, and her chest rose and fell quickly as she tried to catch her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wiped the sweat from her forehead and let out a shaky breath. &#34;Thank God it was just a dream.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her body told a different story-her skin was slick with sweat, and there was a damp, sticky feeling between her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at the sheets in disbelief. She had actually dreamed about being that close to Jeremy. The memory burned through her with embarrassment.She climbed out of bed at once, heading straight for the shower. She scrubbed hard, trying to wash away the heat and shame before dressing in fresh clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night before, Archie had assigned her a new task.This morning, she was expected to attend a project presentation meeting at North Investment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation couldn&#39;t have been more uncomfortable.After dreaming of such an intimate encounter with Jeremy, the idea of seeing him face-to-face made her hesitate to even step outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy heart, Kayla finally exited her apartment building-only to find Liam leaning against his car,clearly waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He approached with a grin. &#34;On your way to work? Let me drive you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla walked past him without saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not giving up, Liam kept pace beside her. &#34;Marsha&#39;s room is all set. She can move in today. If work&#39;s got you busy, I&#39;ll handle everything and make sure she&#39;s settled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t answer. Instead, she pulled out her phone to call a cab.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam grabbed the phone before she could tap the screen and opened the car door for her. &#34;Why bother with a cab when your husband&#39;s right here? Get in.&#34; Kayla didn&#39;t want to, but she was running late. With a huff, she slid into the seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, Liam handed her a small bag.&#34;You probably haven&#39;t eaten yet. I got your favorite breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave the bag a glance before pushing it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she realized they were heading toward Newton Group,she turned to him.&#34;I&#39;ve got a meeting at North Investment today. Just drop me off there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s face darkened a little. He raised an eyebrow.&#34;You&#39;re going to meetings at North Investment now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried a trace of disbelief-like he couldn&#39;t quite imagine her being invited into the halls of North Investment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla met his puzzled look wwith a small, calm smile.&#34;Our company works closely with them. As part of Newton Group, it&#39;s only natural that I&#39;m involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam said nothing for a moment. He knew how Perennia Group had been dragging its feet under his watch. Meanwhile, Kayla was moving between powerful firms, working with people like Archie and Jeremy.The difference stung.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he forced a warm smile. &#34;You&#39;re my wife. I&#39;m happy to see you doing well. How about dinner tonight? Let&#39;s celebrate.&#34; Kayla looked out of the window. &#34;Won&#39;t be possible.I&#39;m busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they arrived at North Investment, she got out without sparing him a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the security guards at the entrance greeted her with respect. Liam sat in the car, watching her walk inside until she disappeared from view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled heavily and lit a cigarette, smoke swirling around his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, his phone buzzed with a call from Janiya.As soon as he answered, she asked, &#34;How are things with Kayla? Have you convinced her to drop the divorce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam was already in a foul mood, and Janiya&#39;s nagging only made it worse. &#34;Mom, I&#39;ve told you-stay out of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya&#39;s voice turned sharp. &#34;If I don&#39;t, Perennia Group will fall apart under you. Your grandfather is watching closely. He won&#39;t let you near Graham Group unless you prove you can handle Perennia. Jeremy won&#39;t help us-that&#39;s fine-but you need to secure Archie&#39;s help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Iknow,&#34; Liam said, impatience creeping into his voice.Suddenly,he caught sight of Zoe stepping out of a cab nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes followed her as she walked into North Investment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam started the engine and pulled away, still on the phone. &#34;Mom, when we brought Zoe over last time,did you notice Jeremy didn&#39;t seem all that thrilled?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya&#39;s voice turned wary.′′Are you saying Jeremy.doesn&#39;t like Zoe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam gave a faint smirk. &#34;Maybe you should figure out what&#39;s really going on between them.&#34;</p>
