                <p>A sudden sneeze escaped Kayla as she sat at the dining tabole, prompting her to quickly dab her nose with a tissue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nagging suspicion crossed her mind-was someone gossiping about her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever the picture of the dutiful husband, Liamn leaned over, fussing and loading her plate with more food.&#34;Kayla, you&#39;ve gotten too thin lately. You should eat a little extra.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of thanking him, Kayla simply pushed the food to the edge of her plate, barely acknowledging it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated at the head of the table, Johnny surveyed the room,his eyes reflecting quiet pride at the seemingly harmonious family meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Zoe looked distinctly uncomfortable. With this being her first visit, she felt out of place. Other than Kayla, she didn&#39;t know a soul. The Graham family&#39;s appraising glances made it clear they saw her as someone angling for a step up the social ladder. She found herself wishing desperately for Jeremy&#39;s arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as dinner went on, Jeremy remained conspicuously absent. Eventually, Johnny broke the silence, turning to the butler. &#34;Go see what&#39;s keeping Jeremy. Why hasn&#39;t he joined us for dinner yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s anxiety grew. The idea of being scolded for overstepping boundaries in Jeremy&#39;s home left her too nervous to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching Zoe&#39;s discomfort, Janiya offered an encouraging smile. &#34;It&#39;s only natural to feel a little awkward your first time here, Zoe. You&#39;ll get used to us. Why not have Kayla show you around thevilla later? You two can catch up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shot Janiya a cold glance. Everyone at the table was well aware she didn&#39;t get along with Zoe, but Janiya still pushed her to play hostess. The move felt deliberately provocative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the chance to smooth things over, Zoe offered Kayla a soft smile. &#34;Sorry to trouble you, Kayla.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya quickly interjected, &#34;Trouble? Nonsense! After you marry Jeremy, we&#39;ll be family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;family&#34; made Kayla want to puke. Zoe marrying Jeremy? The idea left her reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flushed and self-conscious, Zoe dropped her gaze to her plate, cheeks tinged red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warm laugh rumnbled from Johnny. &#34;That&#39;s right! It&#39;s rare for Jeremy to be so taken with someone. The sooner you two make it official, the better. I can&#39;t wait to dote on a grandchild.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brilliant blush swept across Zoe&#39;s cheeks, but a sense of triumph blossomed in herchest. Surely, this meant her spot as Jeremny&#39;s future wife was secure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you really think I wouldn&#39;t notice you all plotting.behind my back?&#34; Suddenly, a low and frigid voice shattered the easy conversation. The entire room froze,silence dropping like a heavy curtain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill rippled down Kayla&#39;s spine. She turned to the source-a tall figure in a crisp shirt and dark slacks,commanding attention from the moment he entered.His presence was magnetic, the sharp angles of his face so arresting that &#34;devastatingly attractive&#34; barely did him justice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jeremy, you&#39;re finally here! Zoe has been waiting for you.&#34; Janiya gave brisk instructions for the servants to bring food, assuming her role as hostess with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the table&#39;s head sat Jeremy&#39;s designated seat, with Zoe positioned beside it-a clear mark of family approval, courtesy of Johnny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervous but hopeful, Zoe glanced up at him, her eyes luminous with feeling. &#34;Jeremy,&#34; she whispered softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, you seem intent on arranging my marriage without my consent. Haven&#39;t I made myself clear enough?&#34; Jeremy&#39;s gaze never flickered Zoe&#39;s way.His words cut through the room like ice as he took his seat, the air around him thick with warning. On the other side, Kayla crossed her arms, rubbing at her skin, trying to dispel the sudden cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny, picking up on the tension, tried to laugh it off.&#34;If your sister hadn&#39;t brought it up, I wouldn&#39;t even know you were seeing someone! I just wanted a family dinner with Zoe, to get acquainted. Or were you planning to keep her a secret forever?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s eyes flashed coldly toward Janiya and Liam.&#34;Perennia Group&#39;s mess has barely settled, and yet you all find time to meddle in my private life now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of uncertainty crossed Janiya&#39;s face before she hastily tried to clarify. &#34;That&#39;s not how it happened at all. Kayla mentioned her sister was seeing you, so l thought this would be a perfect time to introduce her to the family. Jeremy, you&#39;re not exactly a kid anymore.Dad would really rest easier if you finally settled down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam nodded. &#34;That&#39;s right, Uncle Jeremy. We just want to see you happy with someone by your side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her name dropped into the middle of the conversation, Kayla tensed, caught off guard. The weight of Jeremy&#39;s stare pressed down on her,making it impossible to ignore. How could Janiya drag her into the mess?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that&#39;s how it is, Kayla?&#34; Jeremy&#39;s gaze swung to her,his voice icy and sharp, and Kayla felt the chill of his words ripple straight through her.</p>
