                <p>Kayla gave a timid smile. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t dare. Thank you, Jeremy, for letting me stay tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy glanced over at her soaked appearance. His tone was flat but not unkind.&#34;Go inside and clean up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; She dipped her head and quietly slipped into one of the rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the door clicked shut behind her, Jeremy turned and stepped out into the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin approached. &#34;Mr. Graham, I overheard what happened. Liam and Kayla got into a huge fight in the car. He kicked her out-left her stranded in the rain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy arched a brow. Thinking of Liam&#39;s recent behavior, he wasn&#39;t surprised. No woman could endure that kind of humiliation forever. Kayla wanting a divorce made perfect sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worried that the rain might make her sick, Kayla quickly tooka hot shower and put on a thick bathrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even a mild illness could jeopardize her or the baby&#39;s health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did she take in her surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suite was exquisite-lavish furnishings, plush carpeting, and soft, ambient lighting. A place like this must cost thousands a night. It was a world far removed from hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone vibrated on the nightstand where it was charging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked over and saw Liam&#39;s name flashing on the screen. Without hesitation, she declined the call and blocked his number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tossing the phone aside, she lay down on the oversized bed. But moments later, her stomach growled.Normally, she would&#39;ve ignored the hunger. But now she had another life to nourish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still wrapped in the bathrobe, she padded to the door and cracked it open cautiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy, seated at the desk outside, looked up as the door creaked. Their eyes met. Embarrassed, Kayla froze in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had clearly just showered too-his dark hair damp and neatly combed, his robe cinched tightly around his trim frame. The quiet confidence he exuded made her all the more self-conscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi,&#34; she greeted, flustered. Her voice was barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy gave a slight nod.&#34;Hungry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, she blinked. &#34;How did you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You barely touched your food at the dinner party. Then you spent an hour in a thunderstorm. Of course you&#39;re hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was thinking of heading out to find a restaurant. There&#39;s probably one still open nearby, right?&#34; As Kayla spoke,she started heading for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s voice cut through the air, cool and pointed. &#34;At this hour? Everything&#39;s closed. I already had Edwin grab something before the shops shut down. But if you&#39;re set on wandering around in a bathrobe,be my guest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped in her tracks, cheeks burning. &#34;No, that&#39;s fine.I&#39;ll stay here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few.minutes later, Edwin returned, balancing a tray with three sandwiches and a small assortment of fruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MAr. Graham, this was all I could scrounge up. Most places were already closed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy gave a curt nod, then motioned for him to stay.&#34;Join us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla sat down and reached for a sandwich. But after one bite, her face paled. She lurched to her feet and bolted to the bathroom. From inside came the unmistakable sound of retching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy,who hadn&#39;t even touched his food, shat a look toward the bathroom,startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned and turned to Edwin.11|ssomething wrong with the food?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin raised his hands defensively.&#34;NO, sir. I picked it up from a trusted place. They wouldn&#39;t dare mess with the food.&#34; Another wave of gagging and vomiting echoed fromn the bathroom.</p>
