                <p>A sudden, familiar scent washed over Kayla and she found herself swept into a comforting embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s lips nearly brushed her ear as he murmured,&#34;Stay quiet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without protest, Kayla nodded, heart thundering in her chest. With heavy footsteps drawing nearer, she instinctively gripped his jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy shifted, turning her slightly toward the stairwell door. His arms held her close, bodies pressed together as if they were lost in each other,protecting her from view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their pursuers rounded the corner and slowed,surprised by the sight. &#34;These two can&#39;t even wait for a room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle squeeze at her waist made Kayla let out a breathy gasp, the sound just suggestive enough to convince the onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their laughter echoed in the stairwell, and one man swiped a hand across his mouth. &#34;Look at them-can&#39;t keep their hands off each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a few more lingering glances, the group finally turned away and disappeared around the corner.Relief washed over Kayla as the tension melted from her limbs, and she allowed herself to rest in Jeremy&#39;s steady embrace. For the first time that night, comfort replaced her fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tipped her head back and searched his face.&#34;Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unruffled, Jeremy answered, &#34;Let&#39;s worry about you first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerves had Kayla gnawing at her lip. &#34;I never imagined Isaac wòuld go this far. And how did you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of emotion crossed Jeremy&#39;s face,but he didn&#39;t answer. Instead, he broke eye contact and strode toward the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to be left alone, Kayla hurried after him,matching his pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They descended the steps together until Edwin appeared at the landing, alert and ready. &#34;Should I bring the car around,Mr.Graham?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy studied Kayla from the corner of his eye.Something about her expression suggested she was far from finished with the night&#39;s drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Kayla looked up, her voice sharp.&#34;We&#39;re just going to let that creep walk? That doesn&#39;t sit right with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single eyebrow lifted on Jeremy&#39;s face, his calm unshaken. &#34;What&#39;s running through your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly grin crept onto Kayla&#39;s lips. &#34;Please, wait in the car for me. I&#39;ve got something to handle, and it won&#39;t take long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her plan in mind, she slipped off in the direction of the staff break room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin frowned, clearly baffled. &#34;She just escaped a setup and now she&#39;s going back in? What&#39;s her game?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small, knowing smile appeared on Jeremy&#39;s face.&#34;Kayla&#39;s not the type to let things slide. If someone tries to harm her, she makes sure they regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still unsure, Edwin grumbled, &#34;Is she really going to take on all that by herself? Should I help her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy offered no reply, simply heading for the exit without another glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left in limbo, Edwin stood there muttering,&#34;So...am I going or staying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside his suite, Isaac was losing his mind after Kayla&#39;s escape. He&#39;d reduced the room to chaos, overturning furniture and smashing everything in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury crackled in his voice as he jabbed a finger at his men. &#34;What good are you? Couldn&#39;t even handle a single woman! Why do I even keep you around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes glued to the floor, the men stayed silent. One finally stammered, &#34;We checked every corner-she&#39;s vanished. Must&#39;ve slipped out somehow.&#34; The response only made lsaac&#39;s temper explode further. With a vicious kick, he sent the man stumbling.&#34;Useless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no other choice, Isaac picked up the phone and called housekeeping to handle the mess he&#39;d made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hotel worker appeared in the doorway, uniform baggy and hat pulled so low it shadowed the eyes,a mask hiding nearly every feature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jerked a thumb over his shoulder without even looking. &#34;Not a single spot, understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave a silent nod, blending in as she mimed scrubbing and sweeping around the wvreckage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she busied herself, Isaac&#39;s foul mood spilled out in a phone call. &#34;Had a run-in with some stubborn woman tonight-ruined everything. Send a few women up. I need to blow off steam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oblivious to Kayla&#39;s true identity, he stripped down right there, tossed his clothes aside, and strode into the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s gaze sharpened with mischief. She tossed her broom, snatched up every last bit of his clothing,shoes, and accessories, then hauled everything out to the hallway and dumped it in the nearest cleaning cart. Making sure not toleave a trace, she wheeled the cart away and vanished from sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, Isaac emerged from the bathroom, only to stop dead. Not a stitch of his wardrobe remained.He hadn&#39;t even begun to process his humiliation when his phone rang shrilly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac! You&#39;d better get down here this instant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unmistakable voice of his wife cut through his bravado. At home, he never dared cross her-his tough act only surfaced when she was nowhere to be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fumbled for an excuse. &#34;Honey, I&#39;m just... handling business. I&#39;ll be home soon, I swear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snapped back with cold authority, &#34;Don&#39;t feed me that line. I&#39;m at your hotel door, and if you make me wait,you&#39;re done for, you cheating rat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic seized him. In nothing but his underwear,Isaac bolted from the suite and made a desperate dash for the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of his men caught a glimpse of the spectacle.&#34;Mr.Brewer, where are you headed like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac tore through the hallway, flailing in a panic and yelling, &#34;She&#39;s coming! Run!&#34; From behind a column, Kayla emerged with a smirk,casually let the broom clatter to the floor, and brushed her palms clean like the whole mess had never involved her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She strolled toward the elevator and nearly collided with none other than lsaac&#39;s wife herself. Putting on her most helpful expression, she gestured down the corridor. &#34;Ma&#39;am, I think I saw Mr. Brewer sprint that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s wife cracked her knuckles with deadly calm.&#34;That man&#39;s about to meet his end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds later, Isaac&#39;s shrieks bounced off the stairwell walls-each scream more pitiful than the last as chaos erupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t bother to look back. She stepped out into the night air and slid effortlessly into the sleek black car parked by the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,Jeremy lounged with one leg crossed,flipping through a glossy magazine like he hadn&#39;t a care in the world. As soon as the door shut,he folded it neatly and glanced over with a crooked grin. &#34;Feeling satisfied now?&#34;</p>
