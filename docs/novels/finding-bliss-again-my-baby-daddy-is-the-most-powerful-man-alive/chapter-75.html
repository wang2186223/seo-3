                <p>Kayla greeted Edwin with an easy smile and a nod.&#34;That&#39;s right. Today&#39;s the deadline for signing the project contract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood. Mr. Graham has a meeting shortly, so you&#39;ll need to wait for a bit,&#34; Edwin replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator soon reached the top floor. Jeremy strode out ahead of the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she followed, Kayla caught sight of Jeremy fidgeting with his tie, tugging at the knot as though he was overheating in the stale office air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Jeremy ducked into his meeting, Edwin escorted Kayla to the reception lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes trickled by, stretching into almost two hours,until Kayla found herself slumping in her seat, eyelids heavy with exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A secretary slipped in, balancing a tray of water as she eased the door open. Kayla blinked awake and sat up straighter. &#34;Has Mr. Graham finished his meeting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary-a soft-spoken young woman-offered a gentle smile and shook her head. &#34;Not yet. He might be a while longer. If you&#39;re feeling tired, you could always take a quick nap here.&#34; Kayla stretched her arms above her head, stifling a yawn. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;ll browse my phone for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s gaze landed on the untouched coffee sitting on the table. &#34;Not a coffee person, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla glanced at the cup and shrugged. &#34;Not really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary let out a light laugh. &#34;Funny enough, Mr.Graham isn&#39;t a fan either. We never even kept coffee around until Zoe started dropping by all the time.She loves it and insists we always have some ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla lifted her glass and took a slow sip, then set it down with an easy smile. &#34;So, does she swing by to see him a lot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s eyes lit up as she nodded. &#34;She used to come nearly every day. Later on, Mr. Graham told her it wasn&#39;t really appropriate, so now she limits herself to once a week. But honestly, whenever she&#39;s here, she&#39;s quick to complain that we&#39;re not looking after Mr. Graham well enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s mildly irritated tone made it obvious she didn&#39;t think too highly of Zoe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly intrigued by the glimpse into Jeremy&#39;s private affairs, Kayla leaned in and asked, &#34;If she&#39;s that close to him, do they ever go out together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary mulled it over, then replied earnestly,&#34; don&#39;t think so. Mr. Graham&#39;s always tied up with work. Whenever Zoe comes by, she usually leaves alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla grinned and shot back. &#34;So he really isn&#39;t interested in women? Is that just how he is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door to the reception room flew open, and Jeremy strode in without a word of warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stiffened instantly, her entire demeanor switching to deference as she slipped out of the room without another sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla summoned a strained smile, silently hoping Jeremy hadn&#39;t caught her last remark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy entered with a quiet authority, every movement measured and composed. He settled into the seat across from her, his gaze keen and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked up to meet hers, and his tone was icy.&#34;Is Archie keeping you so idle these days? You clearly have plenty of time to trade rumors about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla straightened in her chair, her posture suddenly attentive. &#34;Not at all. I was only making small talk.I trust you&#39;re far too understanding to let it bother you,aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy let out a quiet, dismissive laugh. &#34;You&#39;ve got a real knack for wriggling out of trouble, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla pushed the carefully arranged contract across the table, her lips drawing up in a practiced, polite smile. &#34;Please review the agreement. If everything meets your standards, we can move forward with the signing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drummed his fingers against the tabletop, his expression unyielding. &#34;Frankly, I&#39;m not confident about this project. Didn&#39;t Archie already express my reservations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla replied without missing a beat, &#34;I know you&#39;re hesitant because of the projected low returns. But I&#39;m certain that putting money into this mall will pay off for North Investment. Newton Group is prioritizing mall development this year. Other projects may suffer, but this one is guaranteed to succeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of intrigue passed through Jeremy&#39;s eyes as he examined her. &#34;Did Archie coach you on all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla pressed her lips into a faint smile, her confidence unwavering. &#34;I&#39;m hardly new to this business. If you have any doubts, you&#39;re welcome to Look into my track record.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy leaned back in his chair, a hint of skepticism in his gaze. &#34;Not necessary. Word is, Perennia Group&#39;s entire rise is thanks to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla passed him the pen, her crimson lips curving into a subtle, confident smile. &#34;Then let&#39;s sign, shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief instant, their eyes locked, tension simmering quietly between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, amused laugh slipped from Jeremy as he reached over, took the pen from her fingers, and signed his name with a flourish at the bottom of the contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet breath escaped Kayla, and she wasted no time rising from her seat to collect her belongings. &#34;Looks like everything&#39;s in order. I appreciate your cooperation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s brows knit together, a trace of displeasure flickering across his face. Did she truly intend to walk out the moment she got what she wanted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary hurried in, her expression tense. &#34;Mr.Graham,Mr. Campbell has arrived and is waiting in the conference room. But our pianist just called in sick-the musical performance might have to be canceled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation flickered across Jeremy&#39;s face. He leaned forward, voice cool and edged with frustration. &#34;The piano performance was meant as a courtesy for Mr.Campbell. He expected it, and now you&#39;re telling me it&#39;s canceled?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s shoulders tensed as she dipped her head.&#34;I&#39;ll do my best to find someone else right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla slid the last folder into her bag, quietly preparing to slip out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could take another step, Jeremy&#39;s eyes Locked onto her. His voice, low and commanding,filled the room. &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary. She can handle it.&#34;</p>
