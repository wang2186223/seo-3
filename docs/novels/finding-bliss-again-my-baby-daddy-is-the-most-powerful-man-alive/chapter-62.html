                <p>Kayla searched her pockets with quick taps, only to come up empty. The ring was missing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp jolt surged through her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy, noting her sudden quiet, slipped a ring from his pocket and began to spin it between his fingers with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at his mouth as he said evenly,&#34;Other than me, only Zane owns the same ring.But he already gave his to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla raised her chin, composing herself in an instant.She cleared her throat and replied, &#34;I&#39;m not sure how it got into your hands, but thanks for finding it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned forward to take the ring, but Jeremy shifted at the last second, and her hand slipped past -sending her tumbling into his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arms wrapped around her in a firm catch, and the sudden press of her figure against his sparked a rush of heat through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s faint perfume filled Jeremy&#39;s senses, stirring a restless desire that felt eerily familiar to that night of passion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jeremy lingered in the sensation, Kayla let out a small cry of surprise. Her head bumped his chest, and her movements against him only stoked the fire already rising in his blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy, visibly uneasy, pressed a hand to the top of Kayla&#39;s head and muttered through clenched teeth,&#34;What do you think you are doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her face buried against him, Kayla&#39;s reply came soft and muffled. &#34;My hair&#39;s stuck on your shirt button.I can&#39;t get it loose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still pinned to his chest, Kayla turned bright red,mortified. The steady rhythm of his heartbeat thudded against her ear, only deepening her blush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy inhaled sharply. Every slight movement from her made his restraint waver. He gave her back a light pat. &#34;Hold still. I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his instruction, Kayla froze, not daring to move a muscle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy ducked to search under the seat for something useful, but came up empty-handed.Resigned, he began working through the tangle with his fingers. Kayla winced and let out a cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jeremy,please be careful-it really hurts!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused and pulled his hand back, his tone flat.&#34;|t′S knotted tight. I can&#39;t free it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled in Kayla&#39;s eyes as frustration took hold.&#34;What do you expect me to do now? I can&#39;t stay stuck to you like this!&#34; Jeremy leaned forward and instructed the driver to stop at the next available spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind them, the convoy of cars took another route,veering off instead of following.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From one of the other vehicles, Zoe watched Jeremy&#39;s car disappear down the road. Panic surged as she slammed a hand against the window. &#34;What&#39;s happening? Where&#39;s Jeremy going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver glanced at Zoe through the rearview mirror.&#34;Mr. Graham instructed me to drop you off at home.This way&#39;s faster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe clenched her jaw, unable to protest. It was Jeremy&#39;s directive, after all. Regardless, she struck the seat in frustration, her expression twisted with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her, Liam sat rigid, his tone low and sharp. &#34;Did Uncle Jeremy take Kayla with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was seething. A quick step outside to answer a call had landed him in the same vehicle as Zoe-of all people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe scoffed loudly. &#34;Jeremy probably finds Kayla disgusting. She reeks-her breath&#39;s unbearable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam, already annoyed, turned on her. &#34;You&#39;re the one with bad breath!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me? Kayla&#39;s the one who smells. How dare you insult me like that? What kind of man are you?&#34;Coddled by Johnny&#39;s constant praise, Zoe had grown  smug and didn&#39;t give a damn about Liam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, he snapped. Grabbing a box from the seat,he hurled it at her face. &#34;Keep running your mouth and see what happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shoved the door open and jumped out without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe, frozen in shock, clutched her cheek before screaming after him, &#34;You and Kayla are both trash!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, back in Jeremy&#39;s car, Kayla&#39;s hair remained caught on his shirt, the two still tangled in an uncomfortable closeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla,her cheek nearly pressed into the seat cushion,gave Jeremy&#39;s tie a gentle tug and mumbled, &#34;Are we there yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy turned to the window, eyes on the road ahead.&#34;Take us to that hotel,&#34; he instructed the driver.&#34;Check in under Dewitt&#39;s name. Make it quick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The luxury hotel they were nearing belonged to Dewitt-one of his more lavish ventures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla jerked upright in surprise, only to wince as her hair caught again, yanking at her scalp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are we going to a hotel? What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
