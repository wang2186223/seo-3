                <p>Kayla hurled the bag she was holding straight into.Tricia&#39;s arms, her voice shap and unwavering. &#34;Who said I came out of the obstetrics department? There are several others right next to it. I caught a cold.What&#39;s so strange about seeing a doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia caught the bag, her expression tight with suspicion. She quickly tore it open and dumped everything out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she found were a few boxes of standard cold medicine. Nothing even remotely related to pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of disappointment and simmering anger passed through Tricia&#39;s eyes,but there was no way to vent it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping closer, Kayla raised her hand and tilted Tricia&#39;s chin up. Her presence was firm and commanding,leaving no room for challenge.&#34;You&#39;re mad you lost your job at Perennia Group. I get it. But that&#39;s between you and Liam. A word of advice-stay out of my way. Or don&#39;t be surprised when things turn ugly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Kayla gave her a hard shove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia staggered backward on her high heels and lost her balance, crashing to the floor. The noise caught people&#39;s attention, and soon, a wave of curious and judgmental stares turned their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla casually brushed off her hands and let out a cold scoff. &#34;Since you&#39;ve put your hands all over it, I don&#39;t want it anymore. I&#39;ll just ask the doctor for a new one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second glance, she turned and walked off,her stride steady and confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia, cheeks burning with humiliation, scrambled up and rushed out of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was sure Tricia had left, Kayla circled back to the pharmacy counter to pick up her actual prescription-prenatal vitamins. Thankfully,she&#39;d been extra cautious. If Tricia had seen the real medication,everything would&#39;ve been exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Kayla returned to her desk in Newton Group, Archie called her into his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated behind his desk, he flipped through a stack of documents. &#34;You&#39;ve been doing a solid job with the materials lately-much better than my secretary,to be honest. I should&#39;ve brought you into the company a lot earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave a polite smile. &#34;Thank you, Mr. Newton. I&#39;m still learning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie placed the documents on his desk and clasped his hands together.&#34;With your skills, staying in a junior role in the planning department doesn&#39;t really make sense. Aside from the project you&#39;re already working on. I&#39;ve got a few more lined up. If you manage to complete them well, it&#39;ll be a big win for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d be happy to handle them,&#34; Kayla said with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie turned to his secretary and instructed her to hand over the new assignments. One of them stood out-a pending contract with North Investment, which needed to be signed before the end of the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla paused slightly as she flipped through the files,her fingers stopping on that one contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie noticed. &#34;Is anything wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly shook her head. &#34;No, it&#39;s all good. I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; Archie gave a small smile and watched her leave the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Kayla stepped out, his secretary entered.&#34;Mr. Newton, that North Investment deal has been stuck for ages. We&#39;ve tried getting it signed multiple times with no luck. You really think Kayla can convince Mr.Graham?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie didn&#39;t look up from the papers in front of him.His voice was calm, almost flat. &#34;I just believe she&#39;s got what it takes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla caught a cab to North Investment and spoke with the receptionist, who granted her access.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator lobby was crowded with people waiting around patiently. She spotted one elevator about to close and made a quick dash. &#34;Wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People stared at her strangely, but she didn&#39;t notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right before the elevator doors closed, Kayla squeezed her way in, accidentally bumping into someone. Her forehead hit a solid chest, and the stack of documents she was holding flew from her hands,scattering across the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lost her balance, but before she could fall,a firm arm caught her around the waist, holding her steady.Her body ended up pressed closely against the man&#39;s broad,steady frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent on him was instantly familiar, and her heart started pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly,Kayla looked up,looking all nervous.&#34;Jeremy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy let go the moment she was stable, sliding both hands into his pockets. His voice was cold.&#34;North Investment isn&#39;t the place to charge in blindly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla flushed with embarrassment. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw the papers scattered on the floor and quickly crouched to pick them up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her blouse had a low neckline, and as she leaned forward, the edge of her black bra showed slightly,drawing attention to the shape of her figure. It was hard not to notice. Jeremy, standing right above her, caught the sight. His throat went dry, and he shifted slightly, heat creeping up his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin, who had entered behind him, was about to greet Kayla when Jeremy subtly blocked his view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla straightened up, noticing Jeremy&#39;s slightly red face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head, concerned. &#34;Are you feeling alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t respond. He tugged at his tie and turned to the side, clearly flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Kayla spot the words &#34;CEO&#39;s Private Elevator&#34; on the wall. No wonder everyone else had been waiting instead of entering-this one was off-limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slapped her forehead lightly and muttered, &#34;I should&#39;ve checked before jumping in like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy shot her a glance but didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin cleared his throat to break the tension. &#34;Kayla,you&#39;re here for the contract,right? Mr. Newton already mentioned you&#39;d be coming.&#34;</p>
