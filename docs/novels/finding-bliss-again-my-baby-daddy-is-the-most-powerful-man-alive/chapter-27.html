                <p>Kayla wasted no time approaching Archie. &#34;Mr. Newton, could I ask you something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a warm grin, Archie replied, &#34;Of course. What&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember Cooper Group? You have it as collateral now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cooper Group...&#34; Archie thought for a second, then it clicked. &#34;So that&#39;s your family&#39;s company.My deputy did mention it in an email. We had a contract with Perennia Group, but they failed to deliver, left us in the lurch financially. Unable to cover the losses, they pledged Cooper Group as security.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stayed silent, listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie continued, &#34;You had no idea what your husband was up to, did you? Honestly, Cooper Group&#39;s assets couldn&#39;t even begin to cover what we lost. So Liam decided to charm my deputy&#39;s secretary and pull her into his schemes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie&#39;s eyes gleamed with amusement.&#34;The secretary fell for it and slipped Liam our upcoming project plans. That info is what let Perennia Group crawl back from the brink. When I found out, she was fired immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word landed like a punch. The truth left the small crowd in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humiliation flooded Kayla, her cheeks blazing. She had been played for a fool-Liam&#39;s tricks had even reached as far as Newton Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off in the distance, Jeremy kept hitting golf balls, keeping himself out of the unfolding drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter burst from Dewitt. &#34;Jeremy, your nephew&#39;s really got a talent-turns out his face is his ticket to success. Kayla, talk about bad luck with a guy like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s expression soured, and Dewitt quickly softened his tone. &#34;Hey, it&#39;s not all bad. You&#39;re dumping him anyway, so you&#39;re smart enough to spot a snake.&#34; None of it seemed to register. Kayla&#39;s mind was spinning. How could Liam have hidden so much from her for so long?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice came out low, almost pleading, as she faced Archie again. &#34;Mr. Newton, Cooper Group was my mom&#39;s legacy. Is there any way you could let me have it back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie glanced at Jeremy, his look loaded with meaning. &#34;Newton Group suffered real losses thanks to your husband. Cooper Group is tied up as collateral in their contract with us. That&#39;s not something that can be undone by a simple request.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Kayla didn&#39;t give up. &#34;I realize it&#39;s asking a lot, but Cooper Group is important to me. I need to get it back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thoughtful look crossed Archie&#39;s face. &#34;How about this? Join Newton Group. Show me what you can do. lf you impress me, I&#39;ll hand you the negotiations with Perennia Group to void the contract. The future of Cooper Group will then be in your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla paused,weighing the offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Landing a spot at Newton Group was no small feat-it was the most prestigious company in Trark. A career there would open countless doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, staying put in Trark would upend her plan to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any delay risked exposing her pregnancy; the longer she lingered, the harder it would be to keep her secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright, Mr. Graham?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin&#39;s anxious voice cut through the conversation as he hurried to Jeremy&#39;s side, worry etched across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group&#39;s attention shifted instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swinging a golf club had clearly put too much strain on Jeremy&#39;s still-mending arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to fuss. I&#39;m fine,&#34; he replied. A mischievous glint lit up Dewitt&#39;s eyes. &#34;We set up this whole match, but you show up injured. How are you going to play? You may as well forfeit now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy simply waved off their concerns. &#34;A little scratch like this won&#39;t keep me out of the game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a bodyguard stepped forward and said, &#34;Mr. Graham, Zoe Cooper has arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt&#39;s eyes lit up at the announcement. &#34;Well, what a surprise! Let&#39;s have her join us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Zoe came, her arrival marked by a delicate cloud of fragrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in a sharp white tracksuit, hair pulled into a high ponytail, Zoe looked energetic and ready for anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla fought the urge to roll her eyes. Did Zoe really have to show up everywhere she went?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie, seeing Zoe for the first time, turned with a puzzled look. &#34;And who might this be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt&#39;s voice boomed, maybe with a hint of mischief. &#34;That&#39;s Zoe Cooper, Kayla&#39;s older sister, and Jeremy&#39;s special someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie&#39;s brows shot up, his lips twitching in surprise. &#34;So Jeremy&#39;s girl and his nephew&#39;s wife are sisters?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment didn&#39;t escape Kayla&#39;s or Zoe&#39;s notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s smile grew even more self-assured, though she kept her tone polite. &#34;If Kayla&#39;s made any waves today, I&#39;ll take responsibility for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie simply brushed it aside. &#34;No trouble at all. It&#39;s a pleasure meeting you both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Appreciate it, Mr. Newton.&#34; Zoe shot Kayla a smug look before turning to Jeremy. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t strain yourself,Jeremy.Let me help you inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s face remained a mask, but he surrendered his club to an attendant and stepped away from the green.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe looped her arm through his, wearing a satisfied smile as she escorted him. As everyone headed for the lounge, Dewitt threw out another suggestion. &#34;Since Zoe&#39;s here, why not have her fill in for Jeremy on the course?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe froze for a heartbeat but kept her composure. &#34;Golf isn&#39;t really my thing, so I&#39;ll have to pass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a laugh, Dewitt shrugged. &#34;Jeremy, looks like you&#39;ll have to give up.&#34;</p>
