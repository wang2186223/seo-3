                <p>Jeremy&#39;s expression changed in an instant. His voice turned sharp. &#34;What are you staring at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. Sorry, I&#39;ll pick it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla quickly bent to retrieve the bottles from the floor, but her movement was too quick, and her dress shifted with her.The neckline dipped lower than she&#39;d meant it to, and from where Jeremy stood, the view of her cleavage was impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she rose, trying to compose herself, he stepped forward and draped his jacket over her shoulders. A faint scent of sandalwood clung to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Liam ask you to dress like this and throw yourself at me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving her a chance to respond, he turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stood there, stunned, her mind racing to catch up.But the moment it sank in, her cheeks flushed with anger.&#34;What the hell!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy was exactly as the rumors claimed-cold,  heartless, and impossible to deal with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the car, he tossed the bag of bottles aside like it didn&#39;t matter &#34;Tell my father&#39;s doctor to send the medication to his place from now on. I&#39;m not picking it up again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin nodded from the passenger seat. &#34;Understood,Mr.Graham.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s eyes lingered on the hospital building through the window. &#34;Any update on that woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll push harder on the search,&#34;Edwin replied,his tone calm and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the hospital, Kayla drove straight to Perennia Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still remembered when she and Liam had chosen the company name together. Back then, it was jst a dream. Now, the business had growNn fast, and Liam was rubbing shoulders with the elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter echoed from the general manager&#39;s office,light and playful, followed by a woman&#39;s soft giggle that sounded sweet and teasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without knocking, Kayla pushed the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia was on her knees between Liam&#39;s legs,her body moving in a way that left nothing to the imagination. Seeing Kayla, Tricia sprang to her feet and moved to the side. Her blouse was unbuttoned halfway, showing off a plunging neckline that revealed her cleavage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks looked flushed, her hair slightly messy, and her smile sugary sweet. &#34;Mrs. Graham, what a surprise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam turned to look at his wife, his face paling with fluster for a second. &#34;Kayla?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stood rooted to the spot, her eyes icy as they swept over the scene. The sight alone made her stomach twist in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I walk in on something?&#34;she asked with a sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? No. My pen dropped, that&#39;s all. She was just picking it up.&#34; Liam walked to the door and turned sharply to Tricia. &#34;Get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia didn&#39;t argue. She passed by Kayla on her way out, her perfume trailing in the air-the same one Kayla always smelt on Liam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was loud and clear</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to play it off, Liam poured her a glass of water and said, &#34;Kayla, I&#39;m glad you stopped by. Let&#39;s go out for lunch. We could talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not here for lunch. I came to talk about our  divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glass slipped fromn Liam&#39;s hand, hit the floor, and shattered, sending water splashing in all directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped aside, rubbing his temples like he was holding back a headache. &#34;Kayla, how long are you going to keep this up? I can understand if you&#39;ve just been in a bad mood lately, but if this is about Tricia,I&#39;ll fire her right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t even blink. She wasn&#39;t here to argue. She reached into her bag and pulled out a folder, setting it firmly on the table. &#34;I&#39;m not here to fight over anything. After the divorce, Perennia Group will be yours. I won&#39;t contest it. But I want my share of the money back.And I want Cooper Group returned to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp flash of annoyance crossed Liam&#39;s face.His jaw tightened with rage. &#34;We&#39;re married. We&#39;re in love.How can you be talking about divorce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love?&#34; Kayla laughed coldly. Liam claimed to love her,yet he was in bed with someone else. So this wNas what his version of love looked like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve made up my mind. Sign the divorce agreement.Don&#39;t drag this out.&#34; She slammed the document down on the desk with finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam looked down at the document, and for a brief moment, something vulnerable passed through his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>eyes. &#34;Kayla, what are you doing? Are you really going to throw everything away? After everything we&#39;ve been through?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kayla had long let go of any hope for them. Her voice was cold, flat. &#34;Sign it. Let&#39;s end this completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;End it?&#34; Liam&#39;s expression turned pained. &#34;Just like that? After all these years together, you can just walk away? I love you, Kayla. I said I&#39;d always take care of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She closed her eyes, took a breath, and said steadily,&#34;Spare me the speeches. I&#39;ll believe what I see, not what you say. And I won&#39;t change my mind-Cooper Group must be returned to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s face darkened, and his voice turned defensive.&#34;You gave me Cooper Group yourself. My company is in trouble right now-the accounts are in the red. I&#39;m doing everything I can to save it. Once the major projects go through, I&#39;ll take Cooper Group back. Just give me some time. And stop mentioning divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear now-he&#39;d mortgaged Cooper Group,and getting it back wouldn&#39;t be simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liam, you&#39;re shameless!&#34; Kayla&#39;s voice trembled with disbelief. He knew exactly what Cooper Group meant to her, and he still used it like it was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, we built Perennia Group together. You don&#39;t want to see it fall apart, do you? Using Cooper Group was just a temporary fix. Please, let&#39;s stop talking about divorce. I&#39;ll give you whatever you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam stepped forward and wrapped his arms around her from behind,lowering his head to inhale the scent of her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgusted, Kayla jerked free and spun around, slapping him hard across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s head snapped sideways at the impact, and five red finger marks bloomed on his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly raised a hand to his face, his eyes blazing as he turned back to her, teeth clenched.&#34;Why are you being like this? I&#39;ve already tried to make it right What more do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did this, not me. This marriage is over. I&#39;m done!&#34;</p>
