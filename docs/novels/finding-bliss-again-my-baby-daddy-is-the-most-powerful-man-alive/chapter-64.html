                <p>Kayla collapsed against Jeremy&#39;s chest, utterly drained,her head barely moving as she tried to signal she wNas all right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commotion upstairs sent Jeremy&#39;s bodyguards storming in. Before the server could bolt,they had him pinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s voice sliced through the chaos, cold and absolute. &#34;Keep him here. Bring the car around. We&#39;re heading to the hospital, now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the word &#34;hospital&#34; sent a jolt of panic through Kayla. If she set foot in a hospital, her pregnancy wouldn&#39;t stay secret for long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching Jeremy&#39;s sleeve in desperation, she begged,&#34;Jeremy, please, don&#39;t take me to the hospital!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, the hard line of Jeremy&#39;s jaw softened at the sight of her tear-filled eyes. &#34;You&#39;re injured. Let a doctor take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m begging you, no hospital!&#34; Kayla clung to his arm,her grip desperate, leaving no room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s resistance finally cracked. He gave a sharp nod to his guards, who hurried off to retrieve the first -aid kit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy pulled open the kit and set to work. Kayla, refusing to let him fuss over her, caught his hand.&#34;I can do it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy brushed her hand aside. &#34;You saved me. Let me return the favor-stop pretending you&#39;re made of steel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush crept across Kayla&#39;s cheeks as Jeremy steadily wrapped her wound, a gentle warmth stirring deep within her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingertips brushed her skin, and as he leaned in,the heat of his breath danced against her jaw, making her heart skip and her muscles lock in anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her lips together, every limb taut and unmoving, caught in the charged silence stretching between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft, unblemished glow of her skin only sharpened the dryness in his throat-a pulse of longing he struggled to contain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting his gaze, Jeremy asked, &#34;Why are you so tense?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s blush deepened. She ducked her head,withdrawing slightly as she mumbled, &#34;I can handle it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move,&#34; he insisted, his tone leaving no room for protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fought the urge to linger, steeling himself as he finished bandaging her, every second dragging out his restraint. Kayla&#39;s pulse thundered in her ears, her spine rigid,counting down the moments until he finally released her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re good now. Just stay put for a bit,&#34; Jeremy said and straightened before popping open the top buttons of his shirt and heading for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after he&#39;d stepped away did the heavy air dissipate,letting Kayla breathe again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lingered on her bandaged arm, her nerves still buzzing. The image of that man lunging for Jeremy replayed in her mind-she hadn&#39;t hesitated for a second before throwing herself in the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was because Jeremy had rescued her more than once; she felt bound by an unspoken debt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jeremy strode into the empty guest room,where the server was kneeling on the floor, wrists tightly bound and twNo guards flanking him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy stopped in front of the man, voice edged with ice. &#34;Look at me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the server kept his gaze glued to the floor, one of the guards seized his chin and forced him to meet Jeremy&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy leaned down, studying every line etched into the server&#39;s weathered face. &#34;Who sent you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The server, a grizzled, stubborn man in his fifties,qlared back with unflinching defiance. &#34;I&#39;m here because you ruined my daughter&#39;s life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s brow tightened. &#34;Your daughter? What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The server lunged, only to be shoved back down by the guards. His voice cracked with outrage. &#34;Don&#39;t act.clueless, Dewitt Nicolson! My daughter&#39;s just a college girl, but you destroyed her future! Your dirty money doesn&#39;t scare decent people like us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold chill swept through Jeremy as he pieced it together. Without missing a beat, he pulled out his phone and dialed Dewitt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt&#39;s voice answered on speaker, nearly drowned out by the pulsing bass and rowdy laughter in the background. &#34;Jeremy! What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s voice carried the weight of absolute seriousness. &#34;Dewitt, find a quiet spot. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt ducked out the door,laughing under his breath.&#34;What&#39;s up, man? Miss me already? Heard you checked into a hotel with some woman tonight. Did she wear you out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the quips, Jeremy dove right into the matter at hand. &#34;Just get over here. Kayla got hurt, and it&#39;s on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt&#39;s laughter died in his throat.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy offered no explanation; he simply ended the call. After ordering his men to keep the suspect under tight watch, Jeremy returned to Kayla&#39;s room. She lay across the bed, eyes dull and skin ghost-pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she spotted him, Kayla shot upright.&#34;Was that guy sent by one of your rivals?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy shook his head, then reached over and peeled the blanket from her grip. &#34;Enough. We&#39;re going to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla snatched the blanket back and flopped facedown, refusing to look at him. &#34;Not a chance. I&#39;m already patched up. There&#39;s no reason to drag me to a hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stubbornness was clear as day-she wasn&#39;t budging, no matter what he said.</p>
