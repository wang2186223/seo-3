                <p>Kayla chose to stay the night at the care facility so she could take better care of her grandmother,Marsha Carpenter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver had already cleaned the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Liam arrived with a bag of toiletries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she chatted with Marsha, Kayla noticed and frowned. &#34;I&#39;m the one staying tonight, not you. Take your things and leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam didn&#39;t flinch. His face was serious. &#34;I can&#39;t let you stay here alone. I&#39;ll stay too. Marsha will like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha, still on the bed, nodded with a wide smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kayla didn&#39;t back down. &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary.I&#39;ll stay with Grandma. You should go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam pulled her into the hallway with her and said firmly, &#34;Marsha told me today she wants us to get along.Her health just improved. You wouldn&#39;t want to stress her out, would you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla yanked her arm away with a cold expression  &#34;Who gave you the right to tell me what to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re married. I&#39;m your husband. Just don&#39;t make her worry.okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s see how long you can keep this act going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shoved the door open and walked back into the room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam stood there watching her. He was sure that as long as Marsha was around, Kayla wouldn&#39;t dare bring up the divorce</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Marsha had heard the commotion from the hallway</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Kayla came back in, Marsha asked gently,&#34;Kayla.did you and Liam argue just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla sat beside her and tucked the blanket up to her shoulders. &#34;No, Grandma. Don&#39;t think too much. Just get some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha let out a soft sigh&#34;I&#39;ve watched the two of you for so many years. You&#39;ve always cared about each other. Now that you&#39;re married,you need to hold onto that. Don&#39;t let little things get in the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;|know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t want to trouble Marsha with the truth,not  now So she stayed quiet about her plan to end the marriage</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha gently patted her hand &#34;Liam&#39;s a good man.I know he&#39;ll treat you well You should think about starting a family while you&#39;re young and strong. His company&#39;s doing well, and your life will only keep getting better I just want to see you happy, Kayla&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spoke from the heart, still holding Kayla&#39;s hand,until her eyelids grew heavy and she fell asleep</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla sat silently beside her, not saying a word She couldn&#39;t bring herself to respond to Marsha&#39;s wishes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would wait until the divorce was final before telling Marsha the truth</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Kayla stepped into the hallway, she wasn&#39;t surprised to find Liam still there</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marsha&#39;s asleep? Then let&#39;s rest too.&#34; He reached out to take her hand and lead her back inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kayla stood still</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam turned to face her, his tone growing tight, &#34;Kayla,the doctor said Marsha can&#39;t handle any emotional shocks right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla suddenly said, &#34;I&#39;m hungry.&#34; Liam paused for a second, then smiled &#34;Okay. I&#39;ll get someone to bring you something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.I want you to go get it yourself&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s late. I&#39;d rather stay with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla glared at him with clear impatience. &#34;Are you going or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll go!&#34; Liam gave in, grabbing his coat and heading for the door</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he stepped outside, Kayla pushed the door fully shut behind him and locked it with a loud bang</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam turned quickly, realizing too late what had happened. &#34;Kaylal What are you doing? Open the door!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go home,Liam. You&#39;re not staying here tonight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t answer again. Instead,she lay down on the bed,exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, a wave of nausea rolled through her. She sat up quickly, rushed to the bathroom, and leaned over the sink,retching hard, though nothing came up</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed a handful of tissues and sat down on the toilet,breathing heavily One hand moved instinctively to her lower belly She was pregnant That was a fact she could no longer ignore</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew she needed to divorce Liam as soon as possible and take her grandmother far away from all of this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once her belly started to show, everything would spiral out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then there was Jeremy, that cold and arrogant man For the sake of Perennia Group, she had to stay close to him, but he could never find out about the baby</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling drained and uneasy, Kayla lay back on the bed Just then, her phone buzzed with a new email</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was from North Investment Jeremy&#39;s secretary had invited her to the office the next day</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s heart skipped a beat Did this mean he had agreed to work with Perennia Group?</p>
