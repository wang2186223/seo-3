                <p>The entire day had slipped by while Kayla was tied up with contract details and legal paperwork involving Jeremy and the transfer of company shares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In all that chaos, she hadn&#39;t even noticed her phone had powered off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Liam,growing increasingly anxious from the radio silence, decided to head straight to the care facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha was in the middle of her therapy session A caregiver was seated beside her,keeping her company with light conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping in quietly, Liam carried a few shopping bags filled with supplements and set them on the nearby table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver stood up quickly and gave him a polite nod. &#34;Mr. Graham.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has Marsha been alright today?&#34; asked Liam, offering a brief nod in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was a bit out of sorts earlier, but she&#39;s been  mostly clear-headed since then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go ahead and take a break. I&#39;ll sit with her for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; With that, the caregiver gave a slight bow and left the room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Easing into the chair beside Marsha, Liam reached out and smoothed her hair with a gentle touch. &#34;Kayla didn&#39;t make it today. I wonder what&#39;s keeping her so tied up&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha gradually shifted her gaze, the faint cloudiness in her aging eyes betraying a flicker of uncertainty &#34;Liam, has Kayla gone back to work lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam shook his head &#34;She&#39;s been out of the company for a while now I&#39;ve told her to just rest at home. No point wearing herself out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a relief to hear.&#34; Marsha&#39;s lips curved into a soft smile. &#34;Knowing you&#39;re handling things makes me feel at peace&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet sigh, Liam let his hand fall into hislap.&#34;She hasn&#39;t been herself lately. Talks about divorce have come up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha&#39;s body stiffened as her fingers clutched his.&#34;Divorce? Why would she say that?&#34; He tightened his grip around her hand, his face set with quiet determination. &#34;You don&#39;t have to worry.1won&#39;t let things go that far She&#39;s just been cooped up too long, overthinking everything Once her spirits lift,talk of divorce will be the last thing on her mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though still tense, Marsha&#39;s shoulders relaxed slightly &#34;You&#39;ve been doing your best, Liam Kayla&#39;s lucky she has someone like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To lift her spirits, Liam suggested they go out for a bit He personally helped her into the car and drove them to a nearby park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The afternoon sun poured across the walkways, and the park buzzed with quiet joy-elderly couples playing chess, small groups stretching, others simply sitting and enjoying the breeze</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The breeze rustled gently through the trees as Marsha sat on a park bench, her face lit up with quiet joy while she took in the scene around her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far from her, Liam remained close. His tall build and sharp features didn&#39;t go unnoticed by a group of elderly women seated nearby</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them leaned toward Marsha with a grin &#34;You&#39;re blessed to have such a handsome and attentive grandson.&#34; With a proud chuckle, Marsha corrected her,saying &#34;Oh no, he&#39;s not my grandson. He&#39;s married to my granddaughter&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The compliment clearly touched her, and a warm glow spread across her face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam continued to play his part with care, keeping a watchful eye on her and gently settling his jacket over her shoulders when the wind picked up</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden vibration broke the moment-his phone buzzing from his coat pocket</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious, he pulled it out and checked the screen Tricia&#39;s name flashed across the display With a quick glance toward Marsha, he stepped aside to take the call</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I slipped while getting out of the shower,&#34; Tricia said,her voice trembling &#34;The floor was wet, and I&#39;ve been lying here. I&#39;m scared. Can you come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crease formed between Liamn&#39;s brows &#34;I&#39;m not home right now. This isn&#39;t really a good time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;m alone, and I can&#39;t even stand up Please,I need help I don&#39;t know what else to do.&#34; Tears in her voice made the plea sound even more desperate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t hesitate much longer &#34;Alright I&#39;m on my way&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam thought he&#39;d get her to the hospital and be back before long</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made his way back to the bench and leaned toward Marsha &#34;Something came up I need to run an errand real quick Just stay here, alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in the rhythm of a group of dancers nearby,Marsha only half-heard him and nodded without turning away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Liam&#39;s car rolled out of the parking lot</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Kayla had just wrapped up her errands, her stomach already rumbling. Hunger gnawed at her, and she stopped at the nearest restaurant to eat before the nausea hit again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she skipped another meal, she knew the queasiness would come back full force</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after she paid the bill and prepared to head home, her phone lit up with a call. It was the care facility &#34;Kayla,your grandmother is missing We can&#39;t find her anywherel&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock gripped Kayla like ice Her body wouldn&#39;t move Her mind emptied out in an instant Fingers tightening around her phone, she blurted out, &#34;What do you mean she&#39;s missing? How does someone just vanish?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your husband left the facility with her earlier They haven&#39;t come back, and now we can&#39;t find either of them&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it. I&#39;ll handle it&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting a second, she tried calling Liam But it went to his voice mail</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to the staff, the last ping from Marsha&#39;s tracking device showed her somewhere in a nearby public park</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throwing herself into a cab, Kayla kept stabbing at Liam&#39;s number the entire ride there, but no one answered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If anything happens to Grandma,Liam, I swear l&#39;ll never let you off the hook,&#34; she muttered through clenched teeth, her voice sharp with rage and fear</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The park was still lively with people The staff met her near the entrance. After a quick rundown, they split  into teams and began sweeping the area for any sign of Marsha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes dragged into nearly an hour. Still nothing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s chest tightened with every fruitless step. Her hands trembled. Her throat burned. Liam hadn&#39;t answered at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a final act of desperation, she phoned her father. It was Amaya who picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you expect us to do? We already told you -whatever happens to Marsha has nothing to do with us. She&#39;s not our problem. Don&#39;t call again,&#34; Amaya snapped before hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That heartless response made Kayla&#39;s skin crawl. She pictured Marsha alone somewhere, scared and vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope crumbling, she began stopping strangers at random, holding up her phone with Marsha&#39;s photo.&#34;Have you seen her? Please, just look. She&#39;s missing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most didn&#39;t even glance twice. One woman shrugged Another shook her head. &#34;Sorry, haven&#39;t seen anyone like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath hitched. &#34;Grandma, where did you go?Please be okay.Please come back.&#34; Tears clouding her vision, she stepped off the sidewalk without looking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,tires screeched across the pavement</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A luxury sedan, sleek and black, slammed its brakes just in time. The headlights blasted over her like a spotlight</p>
