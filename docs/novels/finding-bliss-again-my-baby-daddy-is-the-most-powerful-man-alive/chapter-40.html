                <p>Kayla waited for the nausea to settle before cleaning herself up and stepping cautiously out of the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room was quieter now-Jeremy sat alone at the table. Edwin had disappeared</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling awkward, she approached slowly and took her seat. &#34;I&#39;mn sorry. I haven&#39;t been feeling well today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s expression remained unreadable, his handsome features impassive. &#34;If you&#39;re not feeling well, eat a little and get some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Kayla didn&#39;t dare touch the sandwich again, worried he might connect her nausea to something more than just an upset stomach. Instead, she sipped water and nibbled on a few pieces of fruit to settle her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stood to leave, she hesitated. &#34;Thank you for speaking up for me tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s cold gaze lifted. &#34;No need to thank me. You&#39;re part of the Graham family, and protecting you protects our reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liam&#39;s never been that considerate,&#34; Kayla muttered under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that?&#34; Jeremy&#39;s brows drew together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly smiled and shook her head. &#34;Nothing. I&#39;ll head to bed now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Edwin burst back into the room, a pharmacy bag in hand and a proud grin on his face. &#34;Mr.Graham,I found some medicine at the front desk. Picked up a few things for Kayla-thought it might help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s eyes landed on the bag, her heart skipping a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just a cold. She was pregnant. How could she take random medicine?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here you go,&#34; Edwin said as he strode over and handed her the bag. &#34;Thank you, Edwin,&#34; she said quickly, taking the bag and retreating to her room before either man could say more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome!&#34; Edwin replied cheerfully. But as he turned around, he froze under the weight of Jeremy&#39;s icy stare. The air between them turned cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin gave a sheepish chuckle. &#34;What? Why are you looking at me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s tone was razor-sharp. &#34;Since when did you become so thoughtful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin raised his hands in mock surrender. &#34;Just being helpful. She&#39;s your nephew&#39;s wife, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out,&#34; Jeremy ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin didn&#39;t argue, &#34;Got it. Rest well, sir.&#34; He slipped out the door, letting it click shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy remained still, his gaze shifting toward Kayla&#39;s closed door, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla tossed and turned all night, unable to fall asleep. Though exhausted, sleep eluded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Jeremy-just on the other side of the wall-kept her mind racing. Never had she imagined being this close to him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, unable to take the restlessness, she flipped on the lamp and stepped out onto the balcony for some air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence outside was soothing, the cool breeze brushing her skin and calming her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she heard it-a faint sound from the neighboring balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, she grabbed a flowerpot for protection, eyes straining in the dim light.&#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow moved. Slowly, a figure emerged from the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As it drew closer, she realized it was Jeremy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened.&#34;What are you doing out here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer right away. His face was shadowed, but the irritation in his voice was clear. &#34;You&#39;re awake too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could respond, he stepped onto the railing and vaulted onto her balcony with effortless ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stumbled back in shock, clutching the flowerpot tighter. &#34;Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a few steps forward, then stopped, keeping his distance. His expression softened slightly.&#34;I needed somewhere to hide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hide? From what?&#34; she asked, retreating toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her panic, she caught her foot on the frame and lost her balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy moved in a blur, catching her around the waist. The momentum carried them into the glass door with a soft thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,she was pressed against his chest, his arms firm around her. Her breath caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she looked up, her lips brushed against his chin. The moment froze-tense, breathless, and silent. All she could hear was the rapid beat of their hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush crept up her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could pull away, a woman&#39;s voice echoed from the neighboring room. &#34;Where&#39;s Mr. Graham?Why isn&#39;t he here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy moved instantly, switching off the balcony light, plunging them into darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning close to her ear, his breath warm against her skin, he whispered, &#34;Don&#39;t make a sound.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stiffened. She didn&#39;t understand what was happening, but his serious tone left no room for argument.She stayed perfectly still, heart pounding, her entire body on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman&#39;s voice grew louder. &#34;We agreed I&#39;d be spending the night with Mr. Graham. Where could he have gone?&#34;</p>
