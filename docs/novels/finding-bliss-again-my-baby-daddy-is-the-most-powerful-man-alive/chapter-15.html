                <p>Days passed, and Kayla still hadn&#39;t received any word from Jeremy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anxiety growing, she went straight to North Investment But the receptionist told her she couldn&#39;t see Jeremy without an appointment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the pressure mount in her chest, Kayla leaned forward slightly and said pleadingly, &#34;Please, I just need a few minutes with Mr. Graham. It&#39;s urgent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist gave Kayla a dismissive look, her tone laced with sarcasm &#34;Plenty of people want to meet Mr. Graham You&#39;re just another one of them. If I let everyone through, I&#39;d get fired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s face tightened at the receptionist&#39;s obvious mockery</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, knowing she was on their turf, she held back her words</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist flicked her hair back smugly and said,&#34;If you&#39;re not leaving, I&#39;ll have security escort you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla?&#34; a familiar voice called out from behind. Kayla spun around. Relief swept over her face when she saw Jeremy&#39;s assistant approaching.&#34;Edwin!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin gave the receptionist a sharp look. She quickly dropped her gaze, realizing she&#39;d messed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned to Kayla with a polite smile. &#34;You&#39;re here to see Mr. Graham, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small nod. &#34;Yes. Is he available now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s in a meeting at the moment. You might need to wait a bit,&#34; Edwin explained as he led her towards the elevators.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist watched them go, regret heavy in her chest. &#34;She really is one of Mr. Graham&#39;s important guests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Jeremy remained in his meeting, Edwin showed Kayla to the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she sat on the velvet sofa, Kayla tried to calm herself. The richness of the room only made her more restless. She glanced around, her fingers twisting nervously in her lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A secretary stepped in holding a tray. &#34;Ma&#39;am, here&#39;s some coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; Kayla reached for the cup. But the secretary&#39;s hand shook and the coffee sloshed over the rim, splashing onto Kayla&#39;s white blouse</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary gasped and quickly said, &#34;I&#39;m really sorry!Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stood, gently blotting the stain on her blouse with a tissue &#34;It&#39;s alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; the secretary said over and over again,her face full of remorse as she tried to help clean it up</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stayed focused on her blouse, unaware that someone had entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy stood silently at the doorway,his eyes fixed on her. Something stirred in his chest as he watched her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts drifted to that night-foggy,intense-and the shadowy memory of a woman with messy hair and a face he couldn&#39;t fully remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept staring, caught in the moment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla turned and saw him, startled. She quickly moved her hand to cover the damp spot on her blouse.&#34;Have you finished your meeting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coffee had soaked through, making the outline of her black bra just visible beneath the white fabric. Jeremy blinked, suddenly pulled back to the present.His eyes accidentally dropped to the damp spot on her blouse, and a wave of heat crept up his neck. He quickly looked away, his face giving nothing away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping his composure, he stepped further into the room and said, &#34;Edwin said you were looking for me What&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to follow up,&#34; she said carefully. &#34;Have you given any thought to what I proposed the other day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy sat down across from her,legs crossed neatly.His tone was detached. &#34;I haven&#39;t decided yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla tried to stay composed. &#34;Perennia Group is running out of time. I hope you understand how serious this is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go. I&#39;ll take care of it when it&#39;s appropriate,&#34;Jeremy replied coldly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34; Kayla opened her mouth to argue, but Jeremy stood up and walked out before she could say another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Edwin entered. &#34;You should head back for now. Mr. Graham will give you an answer Soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered her a jacket, gesturing subtly at her blouse But Kayla gave a small smile and shook her head&#34;No need Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nothing left to say, she walked out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the CEO&#39;s office,Edwin placed the untouched jacket on a nearby chair &#34;She&#39;s gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s eyes landed on the jacket for a moment,then drifted toward the memory of her standng in that lounge-damp blouse, flustered expression.Something about her tugged at the past</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given that Kayla and Zoe were sisters, the resemblance made sense</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even so, a doubt gnawed at him. Something didn&#39;t add up</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy sat dowvn at his desk and gave an order. &#34;Send her a message. Tell her to bring the contract here tomorrow&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin hesitated. &#34;Are you going ahead with it?&#34;</p>
