                <p>The crowd stilled, all eyes turning to the speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy stood there. Though not under the spotlight, his presence commanded attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His posture was effortless, yet imposing-hands in his pockets, his tailored suit emphasizing every inch of his sharp, statuesque frame. There was a quiet authority about him that made the room hold its breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla turned slowly, her eyes locking with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t expected him to speak up for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam caught the exchange and stiffened, annoyance flaring in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just about to push through the crowd to reach Kayla when Tricia clutched his arm. &#34;Don&#39;t go.Don&#39;t drag yourself into this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam hesitated, jaw clenched, but stayed where he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt stood behind Jeremy, chuckling. &#34;That&#39;s right. Jeremy and I have been sitting by the sofa all evening.Not once did we see Kayla take your earrings. Perhaps you&#39;ve misunderstood her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The accusing woman&#39;s face paled. These weren&#39;t men one could casually provoke-they heId weight in Trark that few could riv/al.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Mr. Campbell and Mr. Newton say so, then I must have been mistaken. I sincerely apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Jeremy speaking up, no one dared argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla met Jeremy&#39;s gaze and offered a faint, grateful smile. Jeremy didn&#39;t respond. He gave her only a brief look before turning and walking away, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later,Archie came over to reassure her, urging her not to take the incident to heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gala wrapped up quickly after the incident. Respect for Jeremy&#39;s word smothered any lingering gossip. When Kayla stepped out of the hotel, her phone rang. It was Liam.&#34;l′mn outside,&#34; he said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked to the curb and saw his car idling nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam was in the driver&#39;s seat, cigarette in hand. Tricia was in the front passenger seat, casually scrolling through her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia rolled down her window, her smile sly and saccharine. &#34;Kayla, do hurry. Liam&#39;s been so patiently waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s eyes narrowed with disdain. She looked past her to Liam.&#34;Since you&#39;re already playing chauffeur for Tricia,Iassume you two have a cozy evening planned. I won&#39;t interrupt. Say what you need to say, then let&#39;s be done with this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam crushed his cigarette and shot Tricia a glare.&#34;Out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia&#39;s smile slipped, but she obeyed, slipping into the back seat without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam looked at Kayla again. &#34;Now will you get in? Or would you rather argue in front of the entire hotel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People nearby were already watching. Kayla, face cold and unreadable, climbed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her door shut, Liam slammed the gas pedal. The car jerked forward, and Kayla nearly hit her head on the dashboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They tore through the city streets at a reckless pace. Kayla clenched her fists, swallowing against the nausea rising in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,Liam pulled over on a quiet, deserted road. The car idled in the silence-tense, stifling.He turned to her, fury crackling in his voice. &#34;I had no idea you were was so tight with Jeremy and Archie. When did that happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t a question; it was an accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam had been simmering with rage all night, and now it spilled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla met his glare coolly. &#34;I&#39;m still a Graham, aren&#39;t I? Your uncle spoke up to protect the family name. Don&#39;t be so childish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam let out a bitter laugh. &#34;You&#39;re so charming, you can make even Mr. Campbell play your white knight.Why stop there? Why not sweet-talk Jeremy and Archie into helping me too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could say more, Kayla&#39;s hand struck his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slap cracked through the car like a whip, sharp and final.</p>
