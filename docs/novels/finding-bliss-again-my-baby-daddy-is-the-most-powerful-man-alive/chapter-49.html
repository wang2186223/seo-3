                <p>As Liam drove Kayla toward the villa, a knot of anxiety.twisted in his stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the restaurant, he hadn&#39;t been able to give her any real answers. Worse yet, he had no clue how she&#39;d discovered that Tricia had already taken up residence in the home they once shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla sat quietly in the passenger seat, her expression composed as her eyes followed the scenery rushing past the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam kept hesitating, casting furtive glances her way again and again. When the car rolled to a stop at the next red light, his restraint gave out. &#34;Tricia&#39;s place had a leak,&#34; he said quickly. &#34;She didn&#39;t have anywhere else to go, so I let her stay at the house for the time being. But I rarely go there. Since you left, I&#39;ve been staying with my mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam stole another look at her, his voice more cautious this tíme. &#34;Kayla, are you angry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla turned to him, her striking features hard and cool. &#34;That house? We bought it together. I&#39;m not even going to get into how much I poured into the design. I covered the down payment. I paid for all the renovations. Tomorrow, make time to transfer the money back. As far as I&#39;m concerned, that house no longer has anything to do with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit him like ice water. Panic rose in Liam&#39;s chest. &#34;Come on, don&#39;t be like that. If you&#39;re upset about Tricia, I&#39;ll tell her to leave today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t about whether she stays or goes. I&#39;m done,Liam. I want a clean break. Is that clear?&#34; Kayla&#39;s lips remained still, but inside, she scoffed. If not for the message Tricia had sent-parading around in her clothes, right there in the home that used to be hers -she wouldn&#39;t have even known the mistress had already settled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s unwavering stance only fueled Liam&#39;s frustration. He stomped on the gas, sending the car hurtling down the road in a burst of reckless fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they finally pulled up in front of the house,Kayla flung the door open and stepped out-only to immediately double over and vomit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew exactly what had happened-Liam,that bastard, had done it deliberately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liam!&#34; Tricia came rushing out of the house, her steps clumsy, her voice shrill. She threw herself into his arms without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Liam tried to pull away, but Tricia clung to him, her arms wrapped tight around his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla took in the scene before her-a carefully staged display of affection. Tricia, draped in a nightgown with her hair spilling over her shoulders, clung to Liam tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, what brings you back?&#34; Tricia pretended to notice Kayla just then, shrinking back from Liam&#39;s embrace with a timid and apologetic demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead.&#34; Kayla&#39;s tone was ice as she cast them a cutting look, then walked into the house without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam shot Tricia a hard glare, jaw clenched, before trailing after Kayla in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were gone, Tricia brushed away her tears,a sly flicker of malice gleaming in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Kayla stepped into the master bedroom and froze.Clothes were tossed carelessly across the bed and sofa, while the vanity overflowed with Tricia&#39;s cosmetics and accessories. Her own belongings had been dumped like garbage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of fury crashed over her. She snatched the ashtray from the table and flung it at the wall. It struck the wedding photo above the bed, cracking the glass and splintering the frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had once believed that photo marked the start of her happiness forever. Now, she&#39;d tear it all down with her own hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; Tricia cried out, startled by the chaos as she stepped into the room. Kayla didn&#39;t even flinch. She was a storm in motion,smashing every last trace of her wedding memories.Even the photos tucked away in the closet were torn from their frames and hurled to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam lunged toward her. &#34;Kayla, what are you doing?Stop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoved him back with a force fueled by rage.Her voice cracked through the room. &#34;I won&#39;t let my pictures rot in this filthy house. Did you two lie here together,laughing at them? Did it excite you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know I messed up-badly,&#34; Liam pleaded,desperation etched in every word. &#34;Please, don&#39;t do this. I&#39;ll tell Tricia to leave right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Tricia darted across the room, collapsing at Kayla&#39;s feet. Gripping her hand, she sobbed uncontrollably. &#34;This is my fault. Not Liam&#39;s. Please don&#39;t punish him. I&#39;ll kneel, I&#39;ll bow-whatever it takes to make things right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood seeped from her knees as she sobbed, her shoulders trembling with every bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam stood nearby, tense and silent, his brows drawn together in unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla remained still, unmoved by the display. Her silence was louder than any words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; Tricia whispered, her face streaked with tears.Then her body gave out, and she slumped to the  floor,unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of panic gripped Liam. If anything happened to Tricia, the blame would fall squarely on him. His voice shot out in alarm, &#34;Call 911! Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise grated on Kayla&#39;s nerves. With the last photo shattered at her feet, she turned away and walked out without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff in the hallway stood frozen, not daring to speak. Their eyes followed her, filled with quiet sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla kept her eyes forward, unfazed by their stares,and was just about to step out when a group of people entered through the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A servant informed them that Liam&#39;s mother and grandfather arrived.</p>
