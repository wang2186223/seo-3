                <p>Jeremy&#39;s intense stare bore into her as Kayla, hands unsteady, reached for the wine bottle and began to pour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was still pregnant. Drinking now could put everything at risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew in a slow breath, her grip shifting to the wine glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could lift it to her lips, Jeremy spoke up.&#34;Relax. I was only kidding. Drinking is a men&#39;s game anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, the group lifted their glasses, exchanged toasts, and drank in one smooth motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relieved, Kayla quietly set her untouched wine glass aside and reached for her juice instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the others carried on their conversation, she politely excused herself and stepped out of the private roomn. Just as she left, her phone buzzed-it was Liam calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you done yet? When are y/ou getting here?&#34; His impatience was obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla checked the time, her tone calm but distant. &#34;I&#39;m having dinner with clients tonight. Probably won&#39;t make it. Let my grandma sleep early-I&#39;ll visit her another day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s voice snapped like a whip. &#34;Clients? Do you even know what kind of people they are? And you&#39;re okay with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resting her back against the hallway wall, Kayla closed her eyes and rubbed her temples, the fatigue creeping in. &#34;This is work-related. And it doesn&#39;t concern you.Stop acting like you still have a say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Work? Don&#39;t make me laugh. You&#39;re just using your body to climb the ladder. Bet you love the way those men stare at you!&#34; Liam lost his temper. The image of her surrounded by men sent his anger soaring, the jealousy eating away at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;Your mind is twisted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s teeth clenched as he snapped, &#34;You really think I&#39;ll believe there aren&#39;t any men with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too tired to argue, she barked, &#34;Believe whatever helps you sleep. If you&#39;re so disgusted, then divorce me.I&#39;m done wasting time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, she ended the call and powered off her phone, shutting him out completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The breeze outside the restroom hit her like a breath of sanity. She leaned against the glass, letting the cool air steady her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jeremy lingered just long enough to exchange a few final words with the group, then slipped out. Another round of waiting awaited him in the private suite next door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he passed the men&#39;s room, voices from inside caught his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Brewer, what led to all this trouble tonight?&#34;Isaac&#39;s assistant lifted the stained trousers, his voice carrying a note of worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of the mirror, Isaac-well into his fifties, with a bloated face and sagging posture-fumbled with his trousers. Though the liquor still lingered in his system,the fog had started to lift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s that woman next to Archie. She forced a drink on me-then dumped it all over me like it was nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant paused, then said cautiously, &#34;I saw a waiter clean up a spill near her seat. Maybe she never drank at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Isaac&#39;s face twisted, uglier than before. Fury lit up his eyes. &#34;She played me? That little bitch!She must pay for it. Make sure she&#39;s in my room tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant glanced around, voice dropping to a whisper. &#34;But Mr. Newton seems pretty protective. If we go through with this, we might step on the wrong toes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac scoffed, brushing off the warning, &#34;You think Archie gives a damn about some nobody? She&#39;s nothing serious. He won&#39;t risk the deal over her.&#34; The assistant gave a nod, tone shifting to quiet obedience. &#34;Got it, Mr. Brewer. I&#39;ll make it happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing that, Jeremy turned and walked off without a word, his face giving nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the table, Kayla kept up appearances,smiling through conversations until she found a moment to excuse herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the elevator, she waited quietly. The doors opened,and there stood Jeremy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s heart skipped. Without hesitation, she spun around and stepped into the next elevator over. Of all nights, she had to run into him. The idea of being stuck in a space with Jeremy was the last thing she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Edwin blinked in surprise. &#34;She rushed off like she couldn&#39;t stand being near us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching himself,he glanced sideways at Jeremy, who now stood still, his face blank, a shadow settling over his face. Edwin knew better than to say more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy raised his face just slightly as he pressedthe button to close the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But fate wasn&#39;t done with them yet. As they stepped out of the hotel, Kayla and Jeremy found themselves arriving at the entrance at the exact same moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, care to ride with us?&#34; Edwin asked, polite as ever. Kayla shook her head, gesturing toward a waiting cab.&#34;No need. I&#39;ll take that one. Wouldn&#39;t want to trouble you both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s dark eyes met hers,cold and steady.′′Aryou sure you don&#39;t want to come with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question, pointed and direct, only cemented her choice. She stood firm. &#34;I&#39;m sure. Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy gave a soft, bitter laugh and slid into the car without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla watched as his car disappeared into the traffic,then walked toward the taxi. Though she hadn&#39;t had a sip, the stench of alcohol clung to her skin. All she wanted was a hot shower and clean clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jeremy&#39;s black car glided down the road,the city lights flickering past. Resting his head against the glass, he shut his eyes, the words from the restroom conversation looping through his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the front, Edwin checked the rearview mirror and spoke carefully. &#34;Mr. Graham, the taxi she took is heading somewhere that&#39;s not her place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shook her head, gesturing toward a waiting cab.&#34;No need. I&#39;ll take that one. Wouldn&#39;t want to trouble you both.&#34;</p>

                <p>The question, pointed and direct, only cemented her choice. She stood firm. &#34;I&#39;m sure. Go ahead.&#34;</p>
