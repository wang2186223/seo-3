                <p>Kayla stifled a smile, adopting a serious expression as she looked at Jeremy. &#34;I really have to thank you for tonight. Without your help, I wouldn&#39;t have gotten out so quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy suddenly felt like teasing her and asked, &#34;And how do you plan to thank me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Kayla blinked, caught off guard. She had only meant to be polite. Was he actually expecting something in return?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the night beyond the car window, Jeremy offered casually, &#34;If you&#39;re serious, you could play the piano for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla noticed the glimmer of amusement in his eyes and realized he genuinely enjoyed hearing her play the piano. It wasn&#39;t a demanding request. She could easily do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their car pulled up in front of a music-themed restaurant. Though it should have been closed at this hour,the manager had rushed back to reopen it the moment he heard Jeremy was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Jeremy made himself comfortable at a table while the staff brought out a variety of light dishes. It was only then Kayla realized that Jeremy hadn&#39;t eaten all night. It seemed the stop was less spontaneous than she thought. He wanted a quiet meal accompanied by her music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy motioned towvard the piano. &#34;You can start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla walked over, tested the keys with a few light touches, then began to play with ease born of long practice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy dined gracefully,occasionally glancing up from his plate to watch her. In her movements, he often caught flashes of his mother&#39;s elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time slipped by. Kayla lost count of how many pieces she played. However,Jeremy never asked her to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, when she turned to check on him,she found him leaning back, eyes closed, fast asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soft lighting cast a golden hue over him, making it look as if he were cloaked in sunlight. He looked dignified and serene-almost untouchable in his stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stared for a moment, mesmerized. Without realizing it, she stepped closer and sat beside him. His features were sharp and refined, like a sculpture carved by God.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing a long eyelash resting on his cheek, she reached out instinctively to brush it away. But just as her fingers touched his skin, his eyes snapped open and his hand shot up, seizing her wrist in a tight grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla winced slightly, her brows furrowing from the sudden pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jeremy saw it was her, he immediately let go,his voice low. &#34;Were you trying to pull something while I was asleep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave an awkward smile. &#34;No. I just saw something on your face and wanted to brush it off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on her a moment longer, unreadable.Then, nodding toward the piano, he said, &#34;You played well tonight. You can leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Kayla didn&#39;t argue. Grabbing her bag,she turned and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was gone, Jeremy remained where he was,raising a hand to rub his tired brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From outside, Edwin entered and placed a coat over Jeremy&#39;s shoulders. &#34;Mr. Graham, it&#39;s late. You should head home and rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a long day filled with corporate meetings and evening social events. Jeremy hadn&#39;t had a moment to unwind until now. Kayla&#39;s music had been soothing enough to lull him to sleep without him realizing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up at Edwin. &#34;How&#39;s the investigation coming?&#34; and his hand shot up, seizing her wrist in a tight grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla winced slightly, her brows furrowing from the sudden pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jeremy saw it was her, he immediately let go,his voice low. &#34;Were you trying to pull something while I was asleep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave an awkward smile. &#34;No. I just saw something on your face and wanted to brush it off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on her a moment longer, unreadable.Then, nodding toward the piano, he said, &#34;You played well tonight. You can leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Kayla didn&#39;t argue. Grabbing her bag,she turned and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was gone, Jeremy remained where he was,raising a hand to rub his tired brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From outside, Edwin entered and placed a coat over Jeremy&#39;s shoulders. &#34;Mr. Graham, it&#39;s late. You should head home and rest.&#34;</p>

                <p>He looked up at Edwin. &#34;How&#39;s the investigation coming?&#34; and his hand shot up, seizing her wrist in a tight grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla winced slightly, her brows furrowing from the sudden pressure.</p>

                <p>Kayla gave an awkward smile. &#34;No. I just saw something on your face and wanted to brush it off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on her a moment longer, unreadable.Then, nodding toward the piano, he said, &#34;You played well tonight. You can leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Kayla didn&#39;t argue. Grabbing her bag,she turned and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was gone, Jeremy remained where he was,raising a hand to rub his tired brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From outside, Edwin entered and placed a coat over Jeremy&#39;s shoulders. &#34;Mr. Graham, it&#39;s late. You should head home and rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a long day filled with corporate meetings and evening social events. Jeremy hadn&#39;t had a moment to unwind until now. Kayla&#39;s music had been soothing enough to lull him to sleep without him realizing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up at Edwin. &#34;How&#39;s the investigation coming?&#34; Edwin nodded. &#34;I was just about to report. We checked the hotel guest list from that night. Zoe was indeed staying there. Apparently, she went out drinking with friends, got too drunk, and ended up booking a room. It looks like she accidentally walked into your suite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;So it really was Zoe that night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All evidence points to her. If it were someone else,we would&#39;ve found something by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Edwin&#39;s phone rang. He glanced at the screen and said, &#34;It&#39;s Zoe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy took a sip of water, his tone calm. &#34;Put her through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s cheerful voice came through the speaker.&#34;Edwin, has Jeremy gone to bed already? I tried calling him, but couldn&#39;t get through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin looked at Jeremy. &#34;He just finished a dinner meeting. Is there something you&#39;d like me to pass along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was hoping to invite him to dinner tomorrow. Would that be aLright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin glanced at Jeremy, who gave a subtle signal by tapping the table twice. &#34;I&#39;ll inform Mr. Graham. If he&#39;s free tomorrow, we&#39;ll send you the details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfectl Thank voul&#34; Zoe hung up. þarely able to contain her excitement. She turned and threw herself into Amaya&#39;s arms. &#34;Mom, this is amazing! I think Jeremy agreed to dinner. He does not suspect anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amaya chuckled, pinching her daughter&#39;s-nose affectionately. &#34;Sweetheart, you&#39;re truly gifted. Even someone as guarded as Jeremy can&#39;t help falling for you. I&#39;ll go make you something nourishing-you need to look your best tomorrow. He&#39;ll be enchanted,I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay!&#34; Zoe beamed as her mother left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile was radiant-until her phone rang again. She glanced at the caller ID and the smile vanished.&#34;Darling, something&#39;s come up at home. I won&#39;t be able to meet you tonight.&#34;</p>
