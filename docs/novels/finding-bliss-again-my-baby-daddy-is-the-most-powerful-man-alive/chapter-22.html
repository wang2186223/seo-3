                <p>At the hotel, Kayla stood at the front desk, handling her check-in and settling the bill, when a sharp, familiar voice cut through the quiet hum of the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if it isn&#39;t Kayla!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Kayla whirled around, and her eyes locked onto a familiar face. Dewitt, one of Jeremy&#39;s closest friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded toward the suitcase by her side. &#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi!&#34; Kayla greeted him, her tone measured as she slid the suitcase a little closer. &#34;There&#39;s been some tension at home. I just need a couple of days away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah,,a quarrel with Liam? So, you&#39;re giving each other some space?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla said nothing. The silence hung between them like a quiet confirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, both receptionists rose from their seats and greeted him with practiced politeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did it click-this hotel was owned by Nicolson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt rested an elbow on the counter, histall frame exuding ease as he tapped his car keys against the polished surface. &#34;She&#39;s my friend. Give her the luxury suite-put it on my tab.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, the receptionists began typing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla moved quickly to intervene. &#34;That&#39;s really not necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jeremy and I are buddies. You&#39;re married to his nephew-that makes you my friend too.A few days here on the house won&#39;t hurt. Let the staff know if you need anything.&#34; With that, he moved to grab her suitcase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla moved to the side, dodging him. Her smile was courteous, her posture resolute. &#34;I appreciate the gesture, but I&#39;d rather pay for my stay. Please, let me handle it.&#34; She extended her card to the receptionist without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist paused, glancing at Dewitt for direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt raised both hands in mock surrender, lips curled in a playful grin. &#34;If she insists, let her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did the receptionist swipe her card and complete the check-in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Dewitt. I&#39;ll be heading up now,&#34; Kayla said softly, keeping her head low as she rolled the suitcase toward the elevators.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Dewitt&#39;s close connection to Jeremy, it was best to steer clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt watched as she stepped into the elevator, her figure vanishing behind the closing doors. With a slight shake of his head, he turned to leave. &#34;Liam&#39;s letting his wife stay in a hotel? What a strange pair they make.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jeremy had spent the entire morning shuffling between back-to-back meetings. Zoe waited in his office the whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally walked in, she jumped to her feet, hurrying over with a tray of pastries and a fresh cup of coffee.&#34;You must be tired. Please, have something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy sank into the leather chair with a quiet sigh, giving her a passing glance. &#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to check on your arm. After all, it was my sister who injured you. I&#39;ve been feeling terrible about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing worth fussing over,&#34; he said flatly. The sharp angles of his face, sculpted and cold, gave nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with his aloof demeanor, Zoe found herself drawn in. A flush crept up her cheeks as she moved a little closer. &#34;At least have a taste of the pastries I made for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin, standing nearby, was just about to remind Zoe that Jeremy wasn&#39;t fond of sweets. But to his surprise, Jeremy reached out, took a pastry, and threw it into his mouth without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief. Since when did Jeremy start liking sweets? Jeremy gave a small nod. &#34;Not bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Then I&#39;ll make more next time!&#34; Zoe&#39;s eyes lit up, thrilled by the praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave them on the table. You&#39;re free to go. I&#39;ve got things to handle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright. I&#39;ll stay with you,&#34; Zoe replied, her gaze steady on him, unwilling to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s brow creased at her insistence. The clinginess grated on him, but the sense of obligation kept his frustration in check. He held back the urge to dismiss her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office door swung open just then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt strolled in nonchalantly,his carefree laughter rolling in ahead of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jeez, Jeremy, it&#39;s freezing in here! Next time, crank up the heat. You&#39;re already icy-no need for the roomto compete with your personality.&#34; His eyes flicked to Zoe beside Jeremy. A knowing smirk curled his lips. &#34;So this is what&#39;s been keeping you so quiet-you&#39;re in a relationship!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color rushed to Zoe&#39;s cheeks, and she dipped her head shyly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy,unamused, shot Dewitt a cold look. &#34;Don&#39;t you have something better to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you aren&#39;t in a relationship? My bad. It just looks like things are heating up between you two,&#34;Dewitt said,sliding a chair forward and settling into it with a mischievous grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy turned to Zoe with a pointed look. &#34;You should leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Don&#39;t forget the pastries.&#34; Zoe spared Dewitt a polite smile before slipping out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt rubbed his chin thoughtfully, his eyes trailing after her for a moment.&#34;Zoe isn&#39;t as pretty as Kayla,and her figure&#39;s not on the same level either. You sure she&#39;s your type?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pen camne sailing through the air and landed in his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt caught it, chuckling as he noticed the dark cloud settling over Jeremy&#39;s face. &#34;Relax, I&#39;m joking.Kayla&#39;s your nephew&#39;s wife-l wouldn&#39;t dare compare her to Zoe.&#34; &#34;Did you stop by just to crack jokes? Is Nicolson Group going bankrupt or something? You sure seem to have plenty of time on your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Going bankrupt? Come on. You&#39;re blowving this out of proportion!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy said nothing, pushing the pastries aside and returning to his documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt leaned on the desk, propping his chin in his hand. &#34;Anyway, I bumped into Kayla at the hotel earlier.&#34;</p>
