                <p>Kayla forced herself to keep her composure. &#34;I&#39;m not sick or anything. My stomach&#39;s just a little upset because of the irregular diet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s voice was frosty. &#34;Just don&#39;t mess up my bathroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed to her cheeks, but she managed a stiff nod. &#34;It won&#39;t happen again. I&#39;ll get out of your way Take care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered him a brief, awkward nod before hurrying toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, voices drifted from just outside the CEO&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Jeremy in there? I heard he&#39;s under the weather, so I stopped by to check on him,&#34; Zoe said to the assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant replied, &#34;He&#39;s busy right now.Would you like me to let him know you&#39;re here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need, I&#39;ll head in myself.&#34; With that, Zoe pushed the office door open</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting on instinct, Kayla ducked back into the lounge and quietly pulled the door shut behind her. Jeremy, catching the movement, glanced over his shoulder. &#34;Why are you still here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned the lock with a soft click, her brows knitting together. &#34;Zoe is here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Zoe saw her and Jeremy alone in the same room,she would undoubtedly cause a scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the thick of her divorce from Liam, she couldn&#39;t afford to let any rumors stir up more trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Zoe, Jeremy&#39;s face tightened. &#34;Just walk out like it&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish his sentence, a sharp knock sounded at the lounge door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s gentle voice drifted through. &#34;Jeremy, are you inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla darted a look around the room, then slipped behind a decorative screen without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy watched her scramble for cover and let out a weary sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she honestly find being spotted with him that humiliating?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the other side of the door, Zoe&#39;s voice rose in warning. &#34;If you don&#39;t answer, I&#39;m coming in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy,too dizzy to bother, didn&#39;t say a word. Zoe,hearing only silence, twisted the doorknob, but it wouldn&#39;t budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her jaw, rattled the handle twice, and called out in mild confusion, &#34;Why&#39;s the door locked?It&#39;s me, Zoe. Open up,will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy, irked by her persistence, hit the remote beside the bed, and the lock clicked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s whole expression brightened as she stepped in with deliberate poise, the sharp click of her heels echoing across the floor. &#34;Jeremy, I heard you weren&#39;t feeling well. I didn&#39;t realize it was this serious-you&#39;re actually stuck in bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla, hidden behind the screen, strained to catch every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy straightened up with a distant air and said,&#34;I need sleep. Unless it&#39;s important, please go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring his words, Zoe perched herself on the bed and reached out to touch his forehead. &#34;Oh no, you&#39;re burning up! Why haven&#39;t you gone to see a doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy shot her down without hesitation. &#34;That&#39;s not necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glimmer of calculation sparked in Zoe&#39;s eyes-she recognized the perfect chance to close the distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, she clung to his arm. &#34;I have a home remedy that works wonders for a fever. Let&#39;s give it a shot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s rejection was cold and immediate. &#34;No.thanks. I&#39;ve already taken my medication.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Medicine won&#39;t act that fast. Just let me help you,&#34;Zoe insisted, her fingers drifting toward the buttons of his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught her wrist in a steely grip, his expression turning thunderous. &#34;What exactly are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning innocence, Zoe fluttered her lashes. &#34;I&#39;m just unbuttoning your shirt. A warm towel will bring your fever down much faster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla couldn&#39;t hold back a silent snort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, her curiosity got the better of her; she edged forward for a better look at how Jeremy would respond to Zoe&#39;s outrageous stunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, Jeremy noticed Kayla&#39;s action. His expression grew even more severe, as if questioning whether she was there simply for the entertainment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe had already undone his shirt, exposing his flawlessly toned chest. The sight made her breath hitch in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy moved to brush Zoe off, but upon catching Kayla spying, a spark of mischief flashed across his eyes. He turned to Zoe, voice slow and intentional &#34;So you&#39;re convinced this remedy works?&#34; Kayla&#39;s brows lifted in disbelief. Was Jeremy seriously playing along with Zoe&#39;s ridiculous act?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe beamed, barely able to contain her delight.&#34;Absolutely! After all, we&#39;ve already been close,so there&#39;s nothing awkward about me taking care of you like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy remained silent, his face giving nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe soon returned with a wet towel and began dabbing his bare shoulders with exaggerated care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching this scene unfold, Kayla felt a wave of revulsion mixed with disbelief. Zoe&#39;s reputation was an open secret-she&#39;d been cycling through boyfriends since high school, her personal life a string of messy scandals. Did Jeremy really have no concerns about her questionable past?</p>
