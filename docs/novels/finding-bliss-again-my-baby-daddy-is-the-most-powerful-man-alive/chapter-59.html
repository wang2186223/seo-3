                <p>Kayla rested her shoulder against the windowpane,letting the flowing piano melody wash over her. The tempo wavered-alternating between gentle and spirited-as Jeremy&#39;s slender fingers moved with practiced ease across the keys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never witnessed Jeremy at the piano before.Soft lighting spilled over him, cloaking his figure in a golden hue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tune stirred something in her, as if drawn from a distant,familiar place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler stepped in quietly and leaned close to speak.Jeremy gave a brief nod,rose from the bench,and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her chance, Kayla crept through the doorway.Her eyes landed on the sheet music resting on the stand, an embellished arrangement of a Tchaikovsky composition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder it struck a chord. Her mother had been fond of Tchaikovsky and used to guide her through his pieces when she was young.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This doesn&#39;t look too hard,&#34; Kayla whispered,her hands itching to try. With the room now empty,she eased onto the bench. Just Now Jeremy hadn&#39;t gotten far when a stream of notes drifted after him, catching his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, glancing over his shoulder with a thoughtful expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler, clearly confused, asked, &#34;Mr. Graham, is®everything all right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy looked away from the door and went to handle other matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla wrapped up the piece soon, her chest full of admiration. Whoever reworked the composition had true skill. As she basked in the final chord, the sound of footsteps neared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alarmed, she sprang to her feet and ducked behind the bookshelf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just caught her breath when the door eased open with a creak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe poked her head through the doorway, her eyes scanning every corner. Spotting no one, she strode in with unwarranted confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes darted across the room before settling on the piano stand. She snatched up the sheet music,skimmed it with disinterest, and let it fall onto the table with a scoff. &#34;Just a mess of scribbles. What kind of rubobish is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She meandered aimlessly, prodding at trinkets and furnishinas along the way. Unimpressed, she sank onto  Now the piano bench and jabbed at the keys, muttering,&#34;That bitch left me alone, and Jeremy&#39;s vanished.Where the hell did they both run off to? I could have used this time to charm him; now it&#39;s blown.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hiding behind the bookshelf, Kayla watched Zoe clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe kept shuffling through the pages carelessly,bumping a nearby glass in the process. Water poured onto the sheet music, soaking the pages beyond repair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the hallway, footsteps approached again. The butler&#39;s voice filtered through the partially closed door. &#34;Mr. Graham, forgive the disturbance, but your father insisted the banquet wouldn&#39;t conclude without your presence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s response came coldly. &#34;Tell him to stay out of my business. This is the last warning he&#39;ll get.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open just as Zoe panicked,stuffing the soggy sheet music into the trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened quickly, fumbling to compose herself as Jeremy entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed slightly. &#34;Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe shifted slightly, angling her body to obscure the trash can behind her. Her voice took on a delicate sweetness. &#34;I was just strolling around after dinner and somehow ended up here.&#34; Jeremy&#39;s attention shifted to the piano stand, the earlier melody still lingering in his mind. A trace of curiosity crossed his face as he asked, &#34;Were you the one playing the piano just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe hesitated fora beat,then nodded with confidence.&#34;Yeah,that was me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the bookshelf, Kayla rolled her eyes. Zoe&#39;s audacity never ceased to amaze her. Just look how she spun lies as effortlessly as breathing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy asked, intrigued, &#34;You&#39;re familiar with that composition?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe gave another confident nod. &#34;Absolutely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler asked, &#34;Ms. Cooper, that piece isn&#39;t easily mastered. Are you certain you&#39;ve played it before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe bit her lower lip, looking a little uncertain now.She avoided offering a clear answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy stepped in closer, his eyes moving to the trash can she tried so hard to hide. Inside, the ruined sheet music rested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone turned cold. &#34;Did you put that there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe quickly shook her head,hands raised as if to push the blame elsewhere. &#34;I had nothing to do with that!That&#39;s how it looked when I got here. Please don&#39;t misunderstand.&#34; Jeremy suggested, &#34;If you&#39;re telling the truth, why not Just Now play a bit of it for me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her face remained composed, a wave of panic churned in Zoe&#39;s chest. &#34;I&#39;m a little tired tonight.Maybe another time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was obviously dodging the question, and she blinked with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy,sharp as ever, saw straight through her. He motioned toward the doorway. &#34;It&#39;s time for you to go.I&#39;ll have someone see you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe lingered,clearly unwilling to leave, but the butler stepped in with a firmer tone. &#34;Ms. Cooper, please return for now. Mr. Graham requires some quiet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, another day then,&#34; Zoe muttered, finally allowing herself to be led out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door shut behind her, and stillness settled over the room once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her hiding place, Kayla watched as Jeremy reached into the trash and gently pulled out the soggy sheet music. He dabbed at it with a tissue, treating each page with a care that spoke volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What made this arrangement so meaningful to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy turned suddenly and made his way toward the bookshelf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gasped slightly, and she pressed herself deeper into the corner, her fingers clutching the edge of her If he realized she had been at the piano, would he be upset with her?</p>
