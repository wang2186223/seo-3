                <p>When Kayla arrived at the office the next morning,her phone buzzed with a notification-Liam had transferred a hefty sum into her account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The amount was staggering,twice what she&#39;d spent renovating their house. Kayla stared at the balance,her heart untouched by the windfall. If only money could purchase her freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could set her phone down, Liam called.&#34;Can you take the day off? I need you to come with me to visit the Cooper family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla declined. &#34;You can manage Johnny&#39;s dinner invitation to Zoe yourself. I&#39;m not getting involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Liam didn&#39;t miss a beat. &#34;Kayla, Grandpa wants us both to handle this. You&#39;re not dumping it all on me. lf you refuse, I&#39;ll tell Grandpa, and let&#39;s see if he decides to pay you a visit in person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stern look crossed Kayla&#39;s face. He always resorted to threats to bend others to his will. Even retired,Johnny&#39;s influence ran deep. Crossing him could mean the end of her career in Trark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But antagonizing Jeremy wasn&#39;t an option either-especially if he hadn&#39;t decided to introduce Zoe to the family. And then there was Zoe herself, a fraud whose secret could unravel everything at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s mind spun with worries, each one knotting tighter inside her skull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s voice cut through again, harder this time. &#34;So what&#39;s it going to be? Are you coming, or should.Grandpa come knock on your door?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla snapped,&#34;Stop talking. Wait for my call at noon!&#34;With that, she hung up on him without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla pressed her fingers to her temples, drawing in a steadying breath. With no safe path forward,she decided her only move was to test the waters with Jeremy first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla,Mr.Newton wants you in the conference room,&#34;a colleague called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla swept her files off the desk and hurried after the summons. &#34;I&#39;m on my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed open the meeting room door and immediately spotted Edwin among the crowd, flanked by several representatives from North Investment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, she hesitated-she&#39;d forgotten Jeremy was sending his people over for today&#39;s meeting. Still, she figured this was her chance to pull Edwin aside later and ask a few discreet questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie, seated at the head of the table, caught sight of her and gestured her in. &#34;Kayla, come join us. You&#39;ll be working on this project team from now on. Get  acquainted with Edwin-he&#39;ll be around a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla crossed the room and greeted Edwin with a polite nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some quick introductions and a whirlwind of discussion, Edwin and his colleagues wrapped up their.visit and started heading out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they reached the ground floor, KKayla saw her chance.She walked Edwin and his team to the doors,then asked secretly, &#34;Has Jeremy been especially busy lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin shot her a curious look, amused by her unexpected question. &#34;He&#39;s always got his hands full.Why, did you want to speak with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all.&#34; Kayla shook her head, brushing off the suggestion. &#34;By the way, are Jeremy and Zoe seeing each other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin gave a short laugh. &#34;That&#39;s not the case at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla arched a brow. &#34;They are not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin rubbed the back of his neck, paused to mull it over, then answered, &#34;Not yet. But tonight, he&#39;s having dinner with your sister. He almost never invites women out like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s thoughts flickered back to the last banquet-she&#39;d overheard Zoe extending that invitation, and Jeremy had accepted immediately. Clearly, he didn&#39;t mind Zoe&#39;s company.An odd tightness twisted in Kayla&#39;s chest at the memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching her thoughtful pause, Edwin queried, &#34;Did you need to see Mr. Graham? If so, you could come with us to North Investment. I&#39;m heading there now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no. Don&#39;t let me keep you. Take care.&#34; Kayla quickly waved him off, retreating a step or two. She watched from the curb as the group slipped into their cars and rolled out of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the CEO&#39;s office at North Investment,Edwin nudged the door open and found Jeremy dressed in a fitted black shirt, lining up a shot at the billiards table in the lounge area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin strolled over as he informed Jeremy, &#34;I&#39;m back,Mr.Graham.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy shot him a sidelong look before flipping another cue in his direction. &#34;Grab a stick and play.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin gripped the cue,lingering by the pool table as he relayed, &#34;I&#39;ve spoken with Archie about the project.Didn&#39;t expect Kayla to join the team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy leaned over for his shot, his expression unreadable. &#34;Archie clearly thinks she&#39;s got potential.He wouldn&#39;t put her on this project otherwise-he&#39;s grooming her for bigger things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin nodded in agreement. &#34;She&#39;s sharp. Handles her work better than most.&#34; Just then, the phone vibrated loudly on the nearby table. Edwin grabbed it and handed it over to Jeremy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler&#39;s voice sounded from the other end, polite but urgent. &#34;Mr. Graham, your father requests your presence for dinner tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy set down the cue, strode over to the bar, and poured himself a drink. His voice came out cool and distant. &#34;I already have plans tonight. Tell him I&#39;ll visit another day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief silence lingered before the butler replied,almost pleading, &#34;But sir, your father said he misses you. If you don&#39;t come, he&#39;ll head out to find you himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation flashed in Jeremy&#39;s eyes. Johnny always resorted to these tactics, pushing him into corners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get it,&#34; Jeremy muttered before hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin asked worriedly, &#34;If you have dinner with your father tonight,what about Zoe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy hesitated for a moment, weighing his options,then picked up his phone and dialed Zoe&#39;s number.</p>
