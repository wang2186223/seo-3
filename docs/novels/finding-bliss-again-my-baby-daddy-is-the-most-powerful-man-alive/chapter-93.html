            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Zoe sat behind Jeremy, her eyes tracing every line of his perfectly sculpted frame. She kept inching closer,drawn in by his charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jeremy felt the shift in energy. Just as Zoe was about to press against him, he pushed her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, she lost her balance and tumbled off the edge of the bed, landing on the floor with a dull thud. The impact left hermomentarily dazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy grabbed a thin blanket and wrapped it around himself. His voice was cold, distant. &#34;I&#39;mn feeling much better now. You can go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Zoe wasn&#39;t ready to give up that easily. Still on the floor, she looked up at him with wide, pleading eyes.&#34;You&#39;re still unwell. Let me stay and take care of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave.&#34; His voice remained calm, but the impatience in his eyes made his meaning crystal clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, Zoe rose and smoothed her dress. &#34;Fine.I&#39;ll come back to check on you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she turned to go, something caught her eye-a flash of fabric peeking from behind the decorative screen. A woman&#39;s garment, not doubt. &#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34; Zoe&#39;s expression darkened. Without hesitation, she marched over, ready to confront whoever was hiding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could yank the screen aside, a strong hand seized her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Zoe spun around, her eyes filled with anger and hurt. &#34;Jeremy, who&#39;s back there? Is it that same woman from before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s face was unreadable, his tone colder than ever.&#34;My personal life is none of your concern.Leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in Zoe&#39;s eyes, spilling over as she stumbled back a few steps, visibly shaken. &#34;How can you treat me like this? I gave myself to you, and now you&#39;re just casting me aside? What will people think when they find out? How can I face anyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Jeremy&#39;s stern expression wavered,a flicker of guilt crossing his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe wiped her cheeks, her voice low and aching. &#34;l won&#39;t ask about it. I know a man like you-rich,powerful-must attract a lot of attention. I&#39;m probably not the only one who likes you. But you promised to marry me. I trusted you, Jeremy. Please, don&#39;t make me regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the screen, Kayla stood with her arms crossed,a faint smirk tugging at her lips. She had to admit-Zoe&#39;s performance was dripping cerity. If she were Jeremy, she might&#39;ve been swayed too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s posture softened, his voice dropping to a quieter note. &#34;Just go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his hesitation, Zoe looked up at him with tear -filled eyes, her gaze tender and unrelenting. &#34;I&#39;ll wait for you. I&#39;ll wait until I&#39;m the only woman by your side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned and walked out, the door clicking shut behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat of silence passed before Kayla stepped out from behind the screen, her tone cool. &#34;Sorry for the misunderstanding. I&#39;ll be going now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her rush, she didn&#39;t see the edge of the rug. Her foot caught, and she stumbled forward-straight into Jeremy. The force sent him back onto the bed, and in an instant, she landed squarely on top of him, their position undeniably intimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips brushed his bare chest. She froze, cheeks flaming red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy sucked in a sharp breath at the warmth of her accidental touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, he didn&#39;t move. His hand reached instinctively toward her, ready to pull her closer.Then he stopped</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s words echoed in his mind, a bitter reminder of his obligations. His growing lack of self-controlound Kayla was starting to unsettle him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shoved her away and rose, grabbing a shirt and throwing it on. &#34;You can go,&#34; he said, his voice tight and composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla,breathless and flustered, pushed herself up, her chest heaving as she tried to steady her pulse.Without a word, she rushed out of the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heart pounding, she made her way to the break room and grabbed a glass of water, taking a few fast gulps in a desperate attempt to cool down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Edna walked in, noticing Kayla&#39;s flushed face. &#34;Are you all right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla tightened her grip on the glass and turned to her with a forced smile. &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks were still tinged pink, her expression caught somewhere between panic and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edna gave her a curious look but chose not to pry.&#34;Mr. Graham&#39;s not feeling well today. He sent out a notice-the vice president will lead the meeting in his place. It&#39;s starting soon. You should head over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; Kayla patted her cheeks, trying to bring herself back to reality as she followed Edna down the hallway</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath, trying to calm her nerves. But no matter how hard she tried, the memory of what happened in that lounge refused to leave her alone.</p>
