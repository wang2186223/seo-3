                <p>Kayla got to the meeting room and discovered that Jeremy hadn&#39;t arrived yet. The meeting was postponed by half an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t eaten that morning,so she decided to grab a quick meal at the canteen. On her way out, she accidentally bumped into someone entering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Milk spilled to the floor, splashing onto the hem of Zoe&#39;s skirt. Zoe looked down, then shot Kayla a glare.&#34;Of course, it&#39;s you. Why do you keep turning up wherever I go? Like some kind of curse I can&#39;t shake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stepped back, unbothered, and replied sharply,&#34;You don&#39;t own this place. I can come and go as l please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quiet canteen suddenly felt charged. A few people nearby glanced over, sensing the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe stormed forward in her heels, towering over Kayla with her chin lifted in defiance. &#34;Apologize. Right now.This is Jeremy&#39;s place, and if I say the word, security will drag you out.&#34; Kayla couldn&#39;t help but laugh. She raised her hand to her lips, her voice laced with amusement. &#34;Oh really?Then why didn&#39;t he say a word for you at the club that night?&#34; Zoe&#39;s face turned beet red. &#34;Stop trying to come between me and Jeremy! People like you shouldn&#39;t even be allowed in here. Leave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Kayla could say anything,Jeremy&#39;s secretary appeared at the entrance, scanning the room. After a moment, the secretary walked over to both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking the secretary had come for her, Zoe gave a smug smile and flicked her hand with confidence.&#34;Told you-he clearly sent someone to get me. You&#39;d better apologize while you still have the chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla said nothing, but a faint smile played on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe stood there,waiting proudly to be acknowledged -only for the secretary to walk right past her and stop in front of Kayla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am, the meeting&#39;s about to begin. Mr. Graham has requested your presence,&#34; the secretary said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla nodded calmly. &#34;Alright. I will join them now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s jaw dropped in shock. She stepped forward in a rush, eyes wide. &#34;Wait-Jeremy&#39;s here? Take me to see him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary paused, then replied politely, &#34;I&#39;m sorry,Ms. Cooper, but Mr. Graham&#39;s tied up at the moment.He asked me to let you know it&#39;s best if you leave for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s expression soured. She pointed at Kayla and barked, &#34;Then why is she allowed to see him?&#34; &#34;She&#39;s here on behalf of Newton Group. She&#39;s scheduled to attend the meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla lifted her work badge with a bright smile. &#34;You heard that, huh? I&#39;m here on business, not to cause a scene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s anger surged, her face flushed with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla brushed past her, lightly bumping shoulders,and walked away alongside the secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe stood frozen in place, seething. She stomped her heel on the floor and muttered through clenched teeth, &#34;Just wait. I&#39;ll prove how important I am to Jeremy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the meeting room, Kayla gave a confident, well -prepared presentation. Her clear explanations and polished delivery earned her a round of applause from the executives around the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the head of the table sat Jeremy, flpping through her proposal with a cold, sharp look on his face. He didn&#39;t find a single flaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the meeting ended, Kayla made her way over to him and asked without hesitation, &#34;Jeremy, do you have any feedback?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy looked up, his dark eyes locking onto hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about his stare made Kayla uneasy. She quickened her steps, stopping just in front of him. &#34;Did I miss something?&#34; Jeremy shut the proposal folder and let it fall onto the table with a casual flick of his hand. Then he crossed one leg over the other and looked at her steadily.&#34;What made you decide to work with Newton Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question caught Kayla off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated for a moment before answering honestly, &#34;They still have control over my mother&#39;s company. If I want it back, I have to help Mr. Newton win a few big deals. That&#39;s what we agreed on from the beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy studied her. &#34;So your ultimate goal is to divorce Liam?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a firm nod.&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded slightly, then stood up, hands in his pockets, and began walking to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not sure whether he was pleased with her work,Kayla hurried after him. &#34;About Newton Group&#39;s other project proposals-can I get your go-ahead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Jeremy stopped. Caught off guard, Kayla bumped into him from behind and stumbled forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and caught her just in time. They fell back slightly against the edge of the conference table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Held in his arms, Kayla looked up at him, her cheeks flushed. She quickly looked away, unable to look into his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s voice came low and cold from above her.&#34;You&#39;re responsible for the projects. Handle them well, and we won&#39;t have any issues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d given his approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s face lit up. She was about to thank him when a knock sounded at the door of the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anybody could say a word, Zoe barged in.&#34;Jeremy, I&#39;m coming in!&#34;</p>
