                <p>Kayla arrived at the Sunshine Garden Restaurant as the.clock struck seven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The restaurant was eerily still. Not a single diner lingered, only a handful of staff gliding through the empty space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A courteous waiter approached and asked, &#34;Ma&#39;am, are you Mrs. Graham?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla inclined her head. &#34;Yes, that&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,this way. Mr. Graham is waiting upstairs.&#34; With that, the waiter led Kayla up to the terrace on the second floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long table gleamed beneath an array of delicate,artfully plated dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the railing, Jeremy waited with his back to her.Dressed in a crisp, dark shirt-collar open, sleeves casually roled-he radiated an effortless authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he pivoted, the overhead lights caught the strong lines of his face, his features sharp yet never severe,a storm of quiet power simmering behind his eyes.Shadows played across his expression, lending him a dangerous, almost magnetic edge. IKayla&#39;s breath caught, lher heart thudding as she tamped dowm the rusl of merves and awe. &#34;Hi, Jeremy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy suid a chair out with a smooth gesture and offfiered, &#34;Have a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla eased herself down across from him, unable to tear her gaze from the lavish feast spread out before her. The savory aroma made her mouth water-she&#39;d barely eaten all day, having only managed a quick snack between caring for Marsha at the care facility.Now her stomach rumbled loudly in protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s sharp eyes caught the hunger in her expression. He leaned in, his voice soft and inviting.&#34;Every dish here was made just for you. Don&#39;t hold back-eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a reason you asked me here tonight?&#34;Though Kayla was eager to dig in, she wanted to clear her doubts first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s gaze turned inscrutable, dark eyes glinting in the low light. &#34;Eat first. We&#39;ll talk after,&#34; he said,leaving no room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no choice but to comply, Kayla picked up her utensils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved with practiced grace, every motion elegant and unhurried. The restaurant&#39;s golden glow brushed over her face, highlighting her delicate features and the tired shadows beneath her eyes Across the table, Jeremy&#39;s own hunger stirred.Without another word, he reached for his knife and fork to join her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla kept Jeremy in her peripheral vision, wary but trying to mask her nervès. Thankfully, he seemed content to focus on his meal, barely making a sound as he ate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She released a breath she hadn&#39;t realized she was holding,her mind racing with plans to eat quickly and slip out at the first opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the last dishes were cleared, a waiter entered,flanked by several burly bodyguards who wheeled in a gleaming grand piano. &#34;Mr. Graham, the piano is here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s curiosity sparked as she watched the scene unfold.&#34;What&#39;s all this for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy set his utensils aside and dabbed his mouth with a crisp napkin, his face composed and unreadable.&#34;I&#39;d like you to play that piece from the other night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawned, and Kayla&#39;s pulse quickened.So that was his real motive for inviting her here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still didn&#39;t know who&#39;d composed that melody,but she could sense its significance to Jeremy. If she botched it, she might offend him-a risk she wasn&#39;t eager to take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her lips together, weighing her words lf At Me before replying softly, &#34;That night, I was just sight-reading. I haven&#39;t practiced much. Maybe you&#39;d rather have a professional play instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s gaze sharpened, his tone brooking no argument. &#34;I want to hear you play it. Just play from the heart-don&#39;t worry about anything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no room to protest, Kayla forced a hesitant nod.&#34;Alright. I&#39;ll give it a shot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose from her chair and approached the piano,her fingertips gliding over the glossy keys. The instrument was nothing short of exquisite-each key promised a lush, resonant tone that seemed to vibrate in the air even before she played.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Jeremy lounged back in his seat,his eyes never leaving her. His gaze was cool and inscrutable as he motioned for her to begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet breath, Kayla sank onto the bench.Resigned, she positioned her hands and let the first notes spill out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her slender fingers danced across the keys, weaving a melody that was both delicate and bittersweet. The music drifted through the restaurant, each note shimmering in the air, haunting and beautiful all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy rested his chin in his palm, watching her every move. As the song built, his thoughts began to wander, slipping into a vivid daydream.Back when he was just a boy. he sneaked out of bed and lingered quietly in the hallway, watching his mother&#39;s silhouette at the piano.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she wrapped up, she greeted him with a gentle smile and summon him over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here, Jay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scampered to her side, his eyes wide with wonder.&#34;What song was that, Mom? It&#39;s beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want, I&#39;ll teach you,&#34; she said, sweeping him onto her lap and guiding his tiny fingers across the cool, ivory keys, her arms wrapped protectively around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla let the final note fade into the hushed restaurant, her hands resting lightly on the keys. With a soft turn, she looked at Jeremy and announced, &#34;I&#39;m done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy hadn&#39;t looked away once. He stood rooted in place, tall and imposing, eyes unreadable in the dim light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence stretched, prickling with tension, until a flicker of doubt crept into Kayla&#39;s chest. Had she messed up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like ages, Jeremy finally moved. He strode over, every step unhurried, and stopped beside her,his shadow falling over the keys. &#34;Where did you  pick up that piece?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla answered quietly, &#34;I learned piano as a kid. The sheet music was in your piano room-I just memorized it after glancing through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rested his fingers lightly on the keys, their closeness crackling with electricity. &#34;You&#39;ve got a good ear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard by the sudden intimacy, Kayla fumbled to her feet-only to misjudge herstep and stumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could right herself, Jeremy&#39;s arms circled her waist, steadying her as they both swayed dangerously close to the piano.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s heart thundered against her ribs. She was pressed against his chest. Her lashes fluttered as she dared to look up, catching the sharp line of his jaw and the unguarded warmth flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand lingered at her waist, the touch firm yet unexpectedly gentle. For a man famed for his iron self-control, he felt his composure slipping in her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy dipped his head, his voice edged with a teasing warmth.&#34;One compliment, and you throw yourself at me?&#34;</p>
