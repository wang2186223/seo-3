                <p>Kayla felt a surge of disgust twist in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Zoe lie so shamelessly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy turned to Zoe, her cheeks burning with shyness. Questions crowded his mind. &#34;Why did you disappear after that night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe scrambled mentally for an excuse, then settled on a sweet, innocent look. &#34;I was scared. I didn&#39;t know who you were then. I was afraid you&#39;d blame me or that my parents would find out. I thought it would be safer to keep quiet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to be afraid.&#34; Jeremy&#39;s voice softened. &#34;If you ever need anything, just tell me.I&#39;ll help however I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s eyes sparkled. She opened her mouth to speak, then hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy caught the flicker of doubt in her eyes. &#34;If there&#39;s something on your mind, go ahead and say it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart pounded. Testing the waters, she asked, &#34;What if I said I wanted to be your girlfriend? Would you say yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air went still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla, watching from nearby, instinctively stepped forward, ready to unmask Zoe&#39;s lies. But she stopped herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clutched a pillar for support, her emotions in disarray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could see it clearly now-Zoe and her mother were trying to manipulate Jeremy. If she stayed silent,he&#39;d continue to be misled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if she spoke up, how would she explain her own involvement?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart twisted in conflict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s cheerful voice broke through her thoughts.&#34;t&#39;s settled then-tomorrow afternoon at Lakeside Dream,you&#39;ll join my parents and me for lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy nodded.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then,Edwin approached. &#34;Mr. Graham, Mr. Newton is requesting your presence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; Jeremy stood. Then, turning to Zoe, he added, &#34;You should come too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s eyes lit up. She practically beamed with excitement.&#34;Of course!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of accompanying Jeremy thrilled her. Maybe this meant she was special to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jeremy walked off, his gaze drifted to the shadows behind a nearby pillar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sliver of a woman&#39;s dress was just barely visible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lingered for a second,then turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after they were gone did Kayla step out of hiding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d meant to leave earlier, but Archie&#39;s secretary came looking for her.′′Mr. Newton would like you at the front hall for the banquet&#39;s opening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be right there,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her way down the corridor, Kayla accidentally collided with a passing waiter. The tray in his hands clattered to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla bent to help. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry! I didn&#39;t mean to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter kept his head down.&#34;|t′Ssfine,&#34; he muttered, before hurrying away without another glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla watched him go, confused. The banquet was in full swing. Why the rush? Shaking off the thought, she continued on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front hall buzzed with music and laughter. Couples mingled under soft lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy stood with Zoe beside him, while Liam was accompanied by Tricia, who clung to his arm like ivy.Even the Campbell couple were in attendance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla,by contrast, was alone. She found a quiet spot along the edge of the room and watched the host speak from the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her isolation, Archie approached. &#34;You don&#39;t look like you&#39;re enjoying the evening. Everything alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla offered a faint smile. &#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded subtly in Liam&#39;s direction. &#34;I saw your husband&#39;s here too. Is he giving you trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile faded. &#34;No. When a marriage reaches this point, even making eye contact makes me sick. It&#39;s easier to keep our distance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie chuckled, hands tucked in his pockets.&#34;Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever been married, but | understand the feeling of wanting to escape. Still, that kind of freedom doesn&#39;t come overnight. You&#39;ll need patience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were kind, and Kayla felt a flicker of gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked, &#34;You&#39;ve never been in a relationship, have you? You wouldn&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be shattered by someone you once loved. That ache-it never really goes away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never dated, but I have loved someone.&#34; A shadow passed over Archie&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla regretted her words instantly. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. That was too personal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie gave a soft smile. &#34;It&#39;s alright. We&#39;re adults-we know how these things go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the host announced it was time for Archie&#39;s speech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spotlight cut through the room, landing on them. Kayla froze.She&#39;d hoped to remain unnoticed, but now every eye was on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s that stunning woman next to Mr. Newton?&#34; someone whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murmurs spread quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Liam&#39;s expression twisted with rage. His fists clenched, eyes locked on Kayla</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia noticed. &#34;Why&#39;s your wife with Mr.Newton? Do they know each other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam didn&#39;t answer, but his jaw tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy glanced over at the sudden attention, then looked away, uninterested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a shriek rose from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God! My earrings are gone! Has anyone seen them?&#34;</p>
