                <p>Jeremy knew Kayla had gotten the wrong idea, but he didn&#39;t feel like clearing things up. Instead,his hand slid to cradle her head, his tone even but warning. &#34;Don&#39;t move unless you want to end up hurt. That&#39;ll be on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation welled up inside Kayla, but she swallowed her response, choosing silence over argumnent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arrival at the hotel, Jeremy took charge at the reception, handling the check-in with practiced efficiency before guiding her toward the elevators.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressed close to his side, Kayla kept her head tucked against his chest, earning them a barrage of curious glances. Behind the counter, two clerks traded knowing looks and hushed giggles as the pair stepped into the elevator together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room key flashed, the lock clicked open, and Jeremy ushered Kayla inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While steering her toward the bed, Jeremy&#39;s foot caught on the edge of the rug, sending both of them tumbling onto the mattress in a heap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A startled gasp escaped Kayla as she scrambled to disentangle herself, but her lips brushed the side of Jeremy&#39;s neck by accident. The moment snapped To Do tight with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hands pressed to the mattress, Jeremy braced himself,knuckles white. A slow flush crept from his collar upward, his whole body humming with an unspoken charge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jeremy!&#34; Kayla&#39;s voice rang out, panic lacing her tone as she shoved against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a rough exhale, Jeremy dipped his head, his whisper rough and close to her ear. &#34;What do you think I&#39;m about to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic thundered in her chest. Alone in a hotel room with Jeremy? Nothing good could come of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; Words failed her as her hands clutched desperately at the sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of advancing, Jeremy swept her up and set her down beside a nearby cabinet. He reached in and retrieved a pair of scissors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glint of metal made Kayla&#39;s heart skip, her muscles tightening in alarm. But with a deft motion,Jeremy snipped the stubborn knot from her hair,severing the strands and their forced proximity all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a small lock of her hair had been trimmed,but the space between them widened, tension broken by the quick, clean cut. Seeing the snipped strands in her hand left Kayla quietly dismayed, but her gaze snapped upward the moment she caught sight of the lipstick smear on Jeremy&#39;s neck. Heat rushed to her face, mortified, and she mumbled, &#34;Sorry about that. I&#39;ll just get out of your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spun on her heel, ready to make her escape, only for Jeremy to catch her wrist in a firm grip and pull her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a startled stumble, Kayla landed against his chest,eyes wide with surprise and nerves. &#34;What&#39;s going on now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every trace of earlier vulnerability vanished from Jeremy&#39;s features, replaced by his trademark,unreadable frost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was chilly as he asked, &#34;Were you the one Lurking in my music room earlier tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornered, Kayla knew there was no way out. &#34;Yes.I didn&#39;t mean to...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s eyes narrowed, scrutinizing her closely.&#34;You&#39;re familiar with that piano piece?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only a little,&#34; she replied, downplaying her skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A follow-up question hung on Jeremy&#39;s lips, but the shrill ring of the doorbell interrupted, slicing through the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot a look at the entrance and finally released her arm.′′V∈′Llfinish this conversation later. For now, go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Kayla wasted no time, slipping toward the exit with barely contained relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hasty departure deepened the scowl etched on Jeremy&#39;s face. A flicker of doubt crossed his mind.Why was she so scared of him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the door, Kayla was greeted by a middle-aged man dressed in server&#39;s attire, balancing a tray of coffee in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a nod of thanks, Kayla stepped aside, holding the door for the server to enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving past the man, Kayla&#39;s eyes caught a suspicious flash beneath the tray. Instinct locked her in place,every sense on high alert. Why would a server be carrying a knife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the suite, Jeremy focused on smoothing the wrinkles from his jacket, his attention momentarily absorbed by his reflection. The server&#39;s approach appeared in the mirror, prompting a brief, distracted instruction. &#34;Just leave the coffee on the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not breaking stride, the server gave a curt nod, but his footsteps veered straight for Jeremy instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of unease shot through Jeremy. Spinning around,he saw the glint of steel as the man whipped out a knife and lunged at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look out!&#34; Without thinking,Kayla burst back inside and slammed into the attacker, throwing him off balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man spun on her, knife flashing dangerously close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy yanked Kayla behind him. The blade sliced across her arm, drawing blood, but Jeremy retaliated instantly-his foot connected hard, launching the attacker through the doorway and into the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cradling her injured arm, Kayla hissed through clenched teeth, her features pinched with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a firm hold, Jeremy guided her to the sofa,settling her down. Leaning close, his voice dropped to a gentle murmur, concern etched in every syllable.&#34;Are you hurt anywhere else?&#34;</p>
