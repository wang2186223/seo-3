                <p>&#34;Are you serious? Where did you even hear that?&#34; Liam and Janiya stared at Tricia, both visibly stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia offered a sly smile. &#34;Just some whispers floating around. But think about it-every time Jeremy shows up at a banquet lately, Zoe&#39;s there too. It has to mean something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam frowned, mentally retracing recent events.Jeremy had been unusually quick to defend Kayla on several occasions. If it was because of Zoe, then it all made sense. It wasn&#39;t about any romantic entanglements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya, on the other hand, gripped his hand tightly,her voice urgent. &#34;Liam, you can&#39;t divorce Kayla now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia&#39;s smile faltered, but she held her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam exhaled wearily. &#34;Mom, I never wanted a divorce.Kayla&#39;s the only one I&#39;ve ever loved. Do you know how much we&#39;ve been through just to get here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya threw a pointed glance at Tricia. &#34;You should get back to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was clear. Tricia straightened her blouse,masking her hurt with a polite nod before quietly leaving the room. As the door clicked shut, Janiya leaned in, her tone low and serious. &#34;I don&#39;t care how many women you&#39;ve fooled around with in the past. This is different. If we want to secure the Perennia Group&#39;s future, you need to lock down Kayla&#39;s loyalty. She has ties to both Jeremy and Archie. That&#39;s leverage we can&#39;t afford to waste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;Mom, I&#39;ve told you-I love her.Stop meddling. I&#39;ll handle it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya snorted. &#34;You love her? Then what was Tricia,a phase? Spare me the talk about love-men throw that word around too easily. I&#39;ve lived long enough not to be fooled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam flushed,her blunt words hitting a nerve. &#34;Enough,Mom. I&#39;ll take care of it. You should go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t get Kayla back, there won&#39;t be a company to save.&#34; WVith that, Janiya swept out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone, Liam stared at a framed photoon his desk -he and Kayla during their university days, smiling,happy. How had it all unraveled so badly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Tricia reentered. Seeing him fixated on the photo made her stomach twist. &#34;Liam? What&#39;s wrong?&#34;she asked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snapped out of it, his voice distant. &#34;Nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved toward him and wrapped her arms around his waist, her voice soft and reassuring. &#34;Whatever happens-divorce or not-I&#39;ll always be here for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression darkened. Memories of Kayla&#39;s accusations of betrayal during their arguments surfaced in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abruptly, he pushed Tricia&#39;s hands away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked,stunned. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam stepped aside, waving her off. &#34;Make a reservation. I&#39;m taking Kayla to dinner tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia&#39;s heart sank, but she forced a smile. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah-choo!&#34; Kayla sneezed, sitting at her desk as evening fell. She reached for a tissue, rubbing her nose and glancing out at the darkening sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was nearly seven. Most of her colleagues had already left, but she wanted to stay a little longer to finish her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed with a notification. It was a reminder from the hospital app-her prenatal checkup was coming up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at it, one hand instinctively brushing over her stomach. With everything going on, she&#39;d nearly forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla? You&#39;re still here?&#34; Archie passed by,noticina Checkup the light still on in her office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly locking her phone, she stood. &#34;I just have a few things left to wrap up. I&#39;ll be heading out soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie walked in, offering a kind smile. &#34;There&#39;ll be more work tomorrow. I don&#39;t want my team burning out. Go home and rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright. I&#39;ll leave by 7:30-just need a bit more time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her resolve, he nodded. As he turned to leave,he paused and looked back. &#34;By the way, your planning insights have been excellent. I want you on the team managing our collaboration with North Investment. Since you already know Jeremy,it should be a natural fit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s smile froze. She had been trying to keep her distance from Jeremy, but now she was being drawn right back in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great. I&#39;ll introduce you to the team tomorrow.&#34;Archie took her silence as agreement. With that, he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla sank back into her chair, exhaling heavily.&#34;Great. Now everything&#39;s ruined.&#34;</p>
