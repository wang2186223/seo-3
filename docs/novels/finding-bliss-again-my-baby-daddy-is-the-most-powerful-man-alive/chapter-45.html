                <p>&#34;Out now!&#34; Jeremy lifted his head, his eyes bloodshot with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Edwin stepped into the officeand spoke to Janiya with firm restraint. &#34;You should leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya stood her ground, determined to speak her mind. &#34;Jeremy, we&#39;re family. Couldn&#39;t you do something for Liam? Hle&#39;s struggling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy offered no reply, his face unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin motioned to the security team, who proceeded to escort Janiya out in a manner that left no room for dignity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the hallway, her argument with the guards grew heated. In the scuffle, a cup of coffee splashed across her dress, leaving a glaring stain. Seething with rage, she stormed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back inside, Jeremy picked up the gift she had brought and dropped it into the trash without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin gave a small nod. &#34;Mr. Graham, she&#39;s left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy dabbed at his hands with a tissue, his tone sharp and cold. &#34;If someone like her ever makes it in again, we&#39;ll be finding a new head of security.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the building, Kayla was about to get into the car with Archie. Her eyes caught sight of Janiya being escorted out, her appearance in complete disarray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning lightly against the car window, Kayla&#39;s lips curled with quiet satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered all too clearly the hardships she had endured because of Janiya. Watching Janiya&#39;s current predicament was undeniably satisfying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie caught the slight smile playing on her lips and tilted his head. &#34;What&#39;s got you smiling like that? Mind letting me in on it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla quickly regained her composure and shook her head.&#34;It&#39;s not important. We should get going, Mr.Newton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Perennia Group, Liam was deep in a meeting when the office doors flew open and Janiya barged in,visibly seething.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He promptly dismissed the others and hurried over to his mother. &#34;Mom, what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya hurled her designer handbag onto the couch and dropped into the seat, her tone sharp with frustration. &#34;Liam, you can&#39;t imagine the disgrace I suffered at Jeremy&#39;s office today. I&#39;m a Graham, and he tossed me out like I was nothing. He wouldn&#39;t even let me finish speaking!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam exhaled, clearly exasperated. &#34;Mom, Jeremy&#39;s never been fond of us. Why do you keep going to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dropped into a more urgent tone. &#34;If I don&#39;t intervene now, Perennia Group won&#39;t survive. I&#39;ve already heard the rumors-you&#39;re knee-deep in a cash flow crisis. Just look at what&#39;s become of the company under your watch. If I hadn&#39;t gone to Jeremy, everything would be over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam scoffed, his expression brimming with self-assurance. &#34;We&#39;re not going under. I&#39;ve already reached out to Mr. Campbell&#39;s team. We&#39;re in talks about a project. Once the funding comes through, we&#39;ll be back on track.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya blinked in surprise. &#34;You got through to Mr. Campbell? I thought he was impossible to reach. How did you manage that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to be concerned,&#34; Liam said with a shrug, purposefully leaving out the fact that Kayla had opened the door for him. With a few noncommittal remarks, he sidestepped Janiya&#39;s probing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her voice and leaning in, Janiya tugged Liam closer. &#34;Guess who I ran into at North Investment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who?&#34; Liam asked, his tone flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your wife!&#34; Janiya declared with theatrical flair, gesturing animatedly. &#34;Kayla was there, bold as ever! Isn&#39;t that odd? How does someone like her even gain access to a place like that? Do you think she&#39;s using her looks to sway Jeremy?&#34; Liam remained unfazed. &#34;I already know. She&#39;s with Newton Group now, and they&#39;ve always collaborated with North Investment. It makes sense that she&#39;d be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Tricia entered, balancing a cup of coffee. Her pink dress clung to her figure, accentuating every curve with deliberate elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling sweetly, she offered the cup to Janiya. &#34;Please, enjoy some coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya accepted it wordlessly, her expression momentarily tight as she cast a dismissive glance at Tricia.Then,turning her focus back to Liam, she said, &#34;Kayla&#39;s come far. Now even Archie&#39;s in her corner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liamn let out a bitter chuckle. &#34;I misjudged her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia chimed in, &#34;There&#39;s something you might not know. Kayla&#39;s sister is dating Jeremy now.&#34;</p>
