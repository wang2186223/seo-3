                <p>&#34;Did you find her?&#34; Dewitt asked eagerly.&#34;Who is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin hesitated, glancing toward Kayla, who sat quietly on the sofa. He was just about to ask if she wanted to step out when Jeremy cut in,&#34;Bring them in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla pursed her lips, instinctively trying to think of a reason to excuse herself. But before she could speak,Edwin turned and opened the door to the private room.A small group of women walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s shoulders relaxed a little-until she spotted Zoe Cooper,her half-sister. Her heart began to thump again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth was Zoe doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just these few?&#34; Dewitt asked, unimpressed. He mumbled under his breath, &#34;They don&#39;t even come close to Liam&#39;s wife in looks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla cast a quick glance at Jeremy, trying to read his expression. His face was blank, cold,and uninterested.He didn&#39;t seem moved by any of the women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he tell none of these women were the one he  was looking for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look up,&#34; Jeremy said, his voice flat but filled with a command that left no room for question</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The women lifted their heads, their eyes instantly drawn to him. For a moment, they all looked slightly stunned by his striking appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s eyes darted to Kayla, brimming with scorn and annoyance. She had heard rumors about Kayla marrying into the Graham family, but nothing had prepared her for the sight of her half-sister in the same room with Jeremy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,in a calculated move, Zoe turned to Jeremy and gasped, &#34;So you&#39;re Mr. Graham!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her theatrics caught Jeremy&#39;s attention. His head turned slowly toward her, his eyes cold but curious</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla let out a small, silent sigh and rolled her eyes.Typical Zoe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And your name is?&#34; Jeremy asked, his tone neutral</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zoe Cooper,&#34; she answered, her voice soft, with the faintest quiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin stepped forward and gently pulled Zoe to the front of the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint from her chest caught Jeremy&#39;s eye Without a word, he reached out and plucked a brooch from her dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s stomach dropped. That brooch. She had noticed it was missing after that night. She had thought it had slipped off somewhere along the way But now, she realized that Jeremy must have found it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their father had ordered two of those brooches. One for Kayla. One for Zoe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s pulse quickened. If Zoe told Jeremy she had the brooch too, it could lead to real trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy studied the brooch carefully, then looked straight at Zoe. &#34;Is this yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Zoe said with a smile that danced dangerously close to flirtation. She stepped in closer.&#34;If you like it,you can have it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34; Jeremy asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zoe Cooper,&#34; she repeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where were you last Monday night, around nine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In a hotel,&#34; Zoe answered right away, without pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy gave a slow nod. He handed the brooch back to her, then turned to Edwin. &#34;No need to continue  Escort them out. Make sure Ms. Cooper gets home safely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Edwin replied with a respectful nod. He could tell Jeremy confirmed Zoe was the woman from that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s heart was racing. No, this couldn&#39;t be happening. He couldn&#39;t seriously think it was Zoe.That woman was a professional liar. But what could she do? She couldn&#39;t step forward and claim it was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While her thoughts swirled in panic, Edwin had already ushered Zoe and the others out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy turned back to Kayla. His sharp eyes settled on her, his brow slightly furrowed. &#34;You know what to do about tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t say a word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave,&#34; he said, his tone final.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla froze. She hadn&#39;t even gotten to discuss the collaboration she came here for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could speak, Dewitt-still grinning and obviously tipsy-called out, &#34;Looks like she doesn&#39;t want to leave. Besides, isn&#39;t it great? She got to witness you finding your mystery woman tonight.&#34; &#34;You talk too much,&#34; Jeremy snapped, giving him a sharp look before turning and walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla jumped to her feet and followed after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin, who had come back after sending the women out of the room, asked with a slight frown, &#34;Do you think Zoe was really the woman from that night?Something about her doesn&#39;t sit right with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt shrugged, leaning back in his chair. &#34;He was the one who spent the night with her. He&#39;d know better than any of us. Let&#39;s just sit back and see how it plays out.&#34;</p>
