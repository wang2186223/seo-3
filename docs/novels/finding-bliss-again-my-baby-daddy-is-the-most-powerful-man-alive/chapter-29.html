                <p>Outside the restroom, Kayla paced nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she turned, Archie emerged. Their eyes locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Waiting for me?&#34; he asked with a cool smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla approached, forcing a calm demeanor. &#34;Could we speak in private?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie arched a brow. &#34;Sure.&#34;,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved to a quiet corner and sat facing each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla twisted her fingers together before asking carefully,′′|sthere any way I can reclaim Cooper Group without joining your company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie offered a faint smile. &#34;I admire your directness. No games, just straight talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave a wry smile, her hands still restless. &#34;If I had time,I&#39;d play the long game. But I don&#39;t.I need Cooper Group back-soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked curious. &#34;And what exactly does that mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said if I joined Newton Group, you&#39;d return Cooper Group to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie leaned back, legs crossed, hands clasped on the table, his refined face breaking into a smile. &#34;Do you know why I agreed to work with Perennia Group back then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla frowned, uncertain. &#34;Wasn&#39;t it because their project had solid potential? Newton Group needed that kind of momentum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recalled the timing-Newton Group&#39;s deal with Perennia Group had launched right after she stepped away from Perennia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came across a proposal,&#34; Archie said, his tone nostalgic. &#34;It blew me away-visionary, one of the most compelling I&#39;d seen in years. I figured any group with that kind of talent was headed for success.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla hesitated. &#34;So, what are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie met her gaze. &#34;Your name was on that proposal. When Dewitt introduced you earlier, I recognized your work. I just hadn&#39;t realized you are Liam&#39;s wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s smile was soft, touched with surprise. &#34;That was a long time ago. I nearly forgot I wrote it. Thanks for remembering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie leaned forward slightly. &#34;Your proposals, your ad campaigns-they were bold, creative. As sharp as Liam&#39;s, maybe sharper. So why did you step away and become a housewife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of regret crossed her face. &#34;I got swept up in love. Lost my judgment. But pain teaches you things.And now, I&#39;ve got a chance to set things right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie didn&#39;t pry. &#34;The door to Newton GGroup is open. Say the word, and you&#39;re in. As for Cooper Group-it&#39;ll be yours when the time is right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla nodded thoughtfully. &#34;Thank you. I&#39;ll give it serious thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be waiting,&#34; Archie said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Kayla walked away, Archie&#39;s assistant approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, she seems close with Jeremy Graham. Are you sure about bringing her on board?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie shrugged. &#34;Jeremy&#39;s already got Zoe, and Kayla&#39;s married. He won&#39;t mind. I care about talent, and she&#39;s got it in spades.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the lounge, Zoe sat across from Jeremy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he ended a video call, she quickly offered him a glass of water. &#34;You must be exhausted. Here-drink this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy glanced at her, voice neutral. &#34;Shouldn&#39;t you be heading home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe straightened, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. &#34;I said I&#39;d stay today, so I&#39;m sticking around till you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>finish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy began flipping through papers, focused. &#34;I&#39;ve got another meeting online. I&#39;ll have the driver take you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No rush. I&#39;m free today. Want a quick shoulder massage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could respond, Zoe stepped behind him and gently placed her hands on his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Jeremy sneezed and recoiled from her touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe froze. &#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin entered just in time. &#34;Ms. Cooper, your perfume is too strong. Mr. Graham&#39;s sensitive to it. You should go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Zoe hadn&#39;t expected the extra spritz of perfume in the restroom to cause such a reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy sneezed again, visibly uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though clearly reluctant, Zoe gathered her things and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was gone, Edwin handed Jeremy a glassof water, then paused. &#34;Sir, your neck!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy frowned. &#34;What about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got red spots,&#34; Edwin said, alarmed. &#34;Did you touch something? Maybe the perfume?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy rolled up his sleeve, revealing more spots along his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t done anything unusual that day. What triggered the reaction?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should get you to a hospital,&#34; Edwin urged. &#34;This doesn&#39;t look good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy waved him off. &#34;No need. There&#39;s a clinic here. Just bring me something for the reaction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But sir-&#34; Edwin protested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said now,&#34; Jeremy snapped. &#34;Stop wasting time.&#34; Grimacing,Edwin hurried out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the hallway, Kayla nearly collided with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Edwin, what&#39;s the rush?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Graham&#39;s having an allergic reaction. I&#39;m getting meds.&#34; With that, Edwin rushed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;Allergic reaction?&#34; she muttered, stepping closer to the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Jeremy looked up. Their eyes met.</p>
