                <p>Archie&#39;s laughter rang out through the phone. &#34;Come.on, Kayla, I just asked how you and Jeremy bumped into each other last night. Why so jittery? You&#39;re family, after all. It&#39;s not like you&#39;re strangers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing a chuckle, Kayla responded, &#34;You&#39;re right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take it easy and don&#39;t rush back. Focus on getting better first,&#34; Archie said before hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla slumped onto the couch, flipping through her contacts until she spotted Jeremy&#39;s office number-the one Edwin had slipped her during her last visit to North Investment, supposedly to make work calls easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Jeremy had gone out of his way to bring her home last night, the least she could do was say thank you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated for a moment, nerves prickling beneath her skin, then took a deep breath and pressed dial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy picked up on the first ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly nervous, Kayla twisted a loose thread on her sleeve and tried to steady her voice. &#34;Jeremy? It&#39;s Kayla.&#34; A pause,then Jeremy&#39;s voice came through, unruffled.&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla hurried to get the words out. &#34;I just wanted to thank you for helping me last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy sounded almost amused. &#34;You jumped in front of that guy for me. This was the least I could do.Don&#39;t mention it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat crept up Kayla&#39;s cheeks. She fumbled for an exit.&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll let you get back to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s clipped tone broke in before Kayla could hang up. &#34;Seven-thirty tonight. Sunshine Garden Restaurant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze, caught off guard by the abrupt invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Consider it a thank-you, Kayla. You saved my life last night. Dinner&#39;s on me,&#34; Jeremy added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went dead before she could muster a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stared at the phone, her thoughts swirling.Jeremy had just invited her to dinner. Was it really just gratitude, or something more complicated? Regret nipped at her-maybe making that call was a mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s just returning the favor,&#34; she muttered, trying to convince herself it was nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Restless, she straightened up her tiny apartment,forcing herself to stay busy. When her energy flagged,she took a short nap. Later, feeling steadier,she pulled on a jacket that concealed her bandaged arm,then hailed a cab to the care facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ducked into a pharmacy along the way and bought a bottle of prenatal vitamins, stashing them deep in her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the cab rattled through city traffic, Kayla&#39;s hand drifted to her stomach, her thoughts drifting to the fragile life growing inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she divorced Liam, she was determined to leave this city behind-she, her baby, and Marsha,starting over somewhere new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cab finally rolled up to the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla paid the driver and headed inside, weaving past quiet nurses until she reached Marsha&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter spilled into the hallway. Kayla peeked in and saw Liam perched on the edge of the bed, grinning as he waved two plush toys in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stepped inside,greeted by the dizzying scent of fresh blooms. The table nearly disappeared beneath a mountain of extravagant gifts, each one bearing Liam&#39;s unmistakable touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla!&#34; Marsha called out, clapping her hands in delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam flashed a gentle smile. &#34;Perfect timing, Kayla. I was just keeping Marsha company. Why don&#39;t you sit with us?&#34; Ignoring his invitation, Kayla set down her bag of fruit with a stiff, deliberate motion, her gaze icy as it locked onto Liam. &#34;Let&#39;s step into the hallway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corridor outside was silent as Kayla squared her shoulders, facing Liam with barely disguised irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam tried to hold on to his easygoing smile, but it faltered. &#34;What&#39;s with the long face? You show up looking like you&#39;ve swallowed a lemon-Marsha&#39;s worried about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla let out a short, bitter laugh. &#34;I told you before -leave my grandmother out of this. How many times do I have to say it? I&#39;m not in the mood to repeat myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to soften the mood, Liam lowered his voice,offering a placating look. &#34;Kayla, Marsha enjoys my visits. I plan to keep coming. I called you last night,but you didn&#39;t answer. Maybe you were tied up.Anyway, there&#39;s something I need to tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Kayla could get a word in, Liam whipped a folded sheet of paper from his pocket and thrust it toward her, his eyes shining with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here-Tricia&#39;s resignation. I&#39;ve signed it. She&#39;s out of the picture for good. You&#39;ll never have to see her again. I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s gaze flicked over the letter, her lips curling into a taunting,ice-cold smile that made Liam falter for a heartbeat, transfixed despite himself. She plucked the letter from his hand, arching a brow with cool disdain. &#34;You think firing Tricia is all it takes to win me back? Keep dreaming, Liam. I don&#39;t recycle old mistakes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she smacked the letter across his cheek and stalked back into the room, slamming the door so hard it rattled the frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone in the hallway, Liam&#39;s face darkened, his fists clenching in silent frustration. &#34;I&#39;ve already said I&#39;m sorry, Kayla. Why can&#39;t you just meet me halfway?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind the closed door, Kayla&#39;s voice rang out,razor-sharp.&#34;I said-get lost!&#34;</p>
