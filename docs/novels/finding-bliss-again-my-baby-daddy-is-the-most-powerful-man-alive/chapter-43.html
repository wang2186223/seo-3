                <p>Archie looked up at Kayla, his expression softening. &#34;You don&#39;t want to go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, gesturing toward her desk. &#34;I haven&#39;t finished my tasks yet. I can&#39;t relax until I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile played on Archie&#39;s lips. &#34;It&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll let you finish them later. For now, come with me to North Investment-I need your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was kind, but there was no room for negotiation. Kayla nodded reluctantly and followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped she wouldn&#39;t run into Jeremy this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty minutes later, they arrived at the headquarters of North Investment. Unfortunately, fate wasn&#39;t on her side.Jeremy was already in the reception room, waiting for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stood slightly behind Archie, instinctively trying to make herself smaller,invisible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy,seated with casual authority, glanced her way briefly, then turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shall we begin discussing the project?&#34; Archie asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men launched into a detailed discussion, the kind that required no input from Kayla, who stood by patiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had worn heels today-poor planning. After some time, her calves ached with the familiar, dull burn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie eventually turned to her. &#34;You can sit, Kayla. We&#39;re all friends here-no need to stand the whole time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, Mr. Newton. I&#39;ll just step out to the restroom first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she exited the room, Jeremy&#39;s gaze followed her for a brief moment before turning away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once outside, Kayla felt her breathing ease considerably. She stood in the hallway, taking deep breaths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several employees passed by, their tailored suits and confident steps echoing the building&#39;s modern grandeur. This was a place for people who belonged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stopped in front of a wall-mounted promotional board, eyes drawn to a familiar face.Jeremy&#39;s photo was displayed prominently, a unique presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might have been born into privilege, but he&#39;d built this empire through sheer force of will. He didn&#39;t just inherit influence-he commanded it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a sharp female voice sliced through her reverie. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla turned to see a striking woman in a fitted black suit standing nearby. Janiya-Liam&#39;s mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya looked barely over thirty despite being well into her forties, adorned in luxury from her earrings to her heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Graham,&#34; Kayla greeted casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed Janiya holding a luxurious gift box, seemingly here to ask Jeremy for a favor. Janiya always held herself in high regard, and for her to personally seek help, it must be related to Liam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya stepped forward, scrutinizing Kayla&#39;s face. &#34;You haven&#39;t even divorced Liam yet, and you&#39;re already this cold to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s voice was even. &#34;We&#39;ll be divorced soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya sneered. &#34;Don&#39;t play dumb. I know all about you and Liam&#39;s issues. A man stepping out once or twice isn&#39;t the end of the world. You need to learn to be more forgiving. Do you really think you can just come and go from the Graham family on a whim?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s reply was razor-sharp. &#34;Funny. I heard Liam&#39;s father had a fling with a salon worker, and you used the Graham name to ruin her. If you couldn&#39;t tolerate betrayal, why should l?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya&#39;s eyes darkened. &#34;You&#39;ve become so disrespectful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is between me and Liam. I&#39;d advise you not to interfere.&#34; Kayla turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A passing employee held a tray of coffee. Without warning, Janiya snatched a cup and splashed it across Kayla&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t even be allowed in this building if it weren&#39;t for the Graham name!&#34; Janiya spat, turning on her heel and striding away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stood still, coffee dripping from her chin, her shirt clinging damply to her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The employee quickly offered her a pack of tissues and asked with concern, &#34;Ma&#39;am, are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. Could you tell me where the restroom is?&#34; Suppressing the storm inside her, Kayla took the tissues and walked off, her pride held together by sheer willpower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The restroom was full, so she found a quieter hallway with a floor-length mirror and began dabbing at her shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy had already finished his meeting with Archie. Now, he was in the lounge, sipping coffee. He loosened his tie, picked up his coffee, and turned casually to the window. His gaze caught on a familiar figure outside.</p>
