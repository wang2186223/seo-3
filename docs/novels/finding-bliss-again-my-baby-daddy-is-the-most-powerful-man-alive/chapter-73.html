                <p>Kayla gave a polite smile and shook her head. &#34;No,thanks. I&#39;ll grab a cab.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t say a word. His driver had already pulled the car up to the curb, and without waiting, Jeremy got in first. He didn&#39;t close the door behind him.He left it open, expecting her to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla hesitated. Standing there felt awkward, and turning him down again would seem rude. Reluctantly,she climbed in after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, the music was soft and calm, nothing like the noise and drama of the club they&#39;d just left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla noticed Jeremy wasn&#39;t leaning back or resting with his eyes closed. She hesitated for a second, then began, &#34;About what happened tonight...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| don&#39;t interfere in women&#39;s business,&#34; Jeremy responded with no real emotion, casually turning the ring on his finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla hesitated again, then finally asked, &#34;Zoe said you plan to marry her. Is that true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell over the car, thick and heavy.Jeremy didn&#39;t respond, and after a moment, Kayla tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and mumbled, &#34;Sorry. I wasn&#39;t trying to pry. Just curious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy let out a dry scoff. &#34;Seems like everyone&#39;s curious about who I&#39;m going to marry. You and Zoe clearly don&#39;t get along. Did my father make you invite her to have dinner with the Graham family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla blinked and gave a small nod. &#34;Yes. I&#39;m still his granddaughter-in-law. I wouldn&#39;t dare go against his orders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s eyes rested on her face, taking in the quiet defiance in her expression. He let out a dry,mocking breath. &#34;So now you&#39;re trying to play the victim with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla coughed quietly and didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence stretched out until the car finally pulled up in front of her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she reached for the door handle, Jeremy spoke. &#34;Liam&#39;s company must be circling the drain if he&#39;s letting you stay in a dump like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla paused, then straightened and replied, &#34;Liam and I have been living separately for a while. What I do now has nothing to do with him. You should head home and get some rest. Goodnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she stepped out and shut the door behind her,walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy watched her walk off,her posture straight and her steps fast. &#34;Just mention Liam and she lights up like a fuse,&#34; he muttered to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s arm had mostly healed. That morning,she made time for a prenatal check-up. Inside the ultrasound room, the doctor studied her scan carefully and said, &#34;Everything looks good, but the next couple of months are important. Try to avoid stress and take it easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla let out a soft breath. Relief spread through her chest. Over the past month, the baby had quietly claimed a place in her heart. Even if it hadn&#39;t been planned, it was hers-and she wanted to protect it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, doctor.&#34; Kayla slipped back into her clothes and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked down the corridor, Tricia happened to look up and caught a glimpse of her turning the corner. &#34;Kayla?&#34; She rushed to catch up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stood in line at the pharmacy, head down,scrolling through messages in her work group chat.When she glanced up, she caught sight of Tricia&#39;s reflection in the glass window ahead, watching her from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned slightly. Using the crowd to her advantage, she quietly stepped out of the queue and disappeared.Tricia, distracted for only a moment, suddenly found Kayla was gone. She glanced around in confusion.&#34;Huh? Where&#39;d she go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looking for me?&#34; The voice came from behind,startling Tricia so much that she spun around,clutching her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stood there, arms crossed, a small pharmacy bag dangling from one hand, her expression cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia clutched her purse tighter,her voice sharp.&#34;Are you pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla raised an eyebrow, then laughed-light but cutting.She looked Tricia straight in the eye and asked,&#34;Who told you that? Or do you wish to get pregnant yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia&#39;s face stiffened. She instinctively moved the medical report behind her back, trying to hide it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s smile grew as she watched Tricia squirm.Earlier, she&#39;d seen Tricia&#39;s name flash on the screen but had brushed it off, thinking it must be someone else with the same name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, are you making fun of me?&#34; Tricia snapped,clearly rattled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Touchy, aren&#39;t we? Let me guess...&#34; Kayla said,twirling the medicine bag by its string. &#34;You thought you were pregnant. And when the result said no, you couldn&#39;t hide your disappointment.&#34; Tricia&#39;s cheeks turned bright red. She stepped forward,ready to argue, but something in Kayla&#39;s gaze stopped her cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, Tricia hadn&#39;t been feeling like herself lately and started thinking she might be pregnant.The idea actually excited her-she thought it might finally make Liam take her seriously. But the test results were a letdown. She wasn&#39;t pregnant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla could see it all over her face. She gave a short laugh and said, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ve always been good at inserting yourself where you don&#39;t belong. If you try hard enough, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll manage to have Liam&#39;s baby one day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia&#39;s glare sharpened. Her voice turned icy. &#34;And what about you? Why were you coming out of the obstetrics department? You really think I&#39;m that naive?&#34;</p>
