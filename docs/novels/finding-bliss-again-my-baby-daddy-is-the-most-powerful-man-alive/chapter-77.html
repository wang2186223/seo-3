                <p>Liam stood frozen, his hand tightening on Kayla&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know l messed up,&#34; he said, desperation in his voice,eyes locked on hers. &#34;But I&#39;ve changed. I want to fix this. I swear, I&#39;ll never hurt you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s too late. We&#39;re already done.&#34; Kayla shoved him away,then brushed off the spot where he&#39;d touched her,like wiping off something filthy. Her voice was cold and final. &#34;We should go through with the divorce. The longer you drag this out, the worse it gets-for both of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then,the director walked over, his tone polite but firm. &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Graham, I&#39;d like to discuss something regarding Marsha. Could we talk in my office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;I can go alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Liam, refusingto step back, quickly added, &#34;I&#39;m coming too. Marsha is like family to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla turned and gave him a withering stare, her eyes full of contempt. She didn&#39;t say anything, but the look alone said enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the office, the two of them sat stiffly beside each other as the director began to explain the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Liam&#39;s phone kept ringing nonstop, the sound getting on Kayla&#39;s nerves</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flung him an irritated glare and spat, &#34;Either pick.up or switch it off before I lose my patience!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to stay composed, Liam stood and gave a polite nod. &#34;Probably something urgent from work.I&#39;ll take it outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The director nodded in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once in the hallway, Liam glanced down at the screen.The number was all too familiar. His jaw tightened as he answered, voice low. &#34;I already sent you the money.What else do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, a soft, sugary voice repled,&#34;Liam,I love you so much. I don&#39;t want to leave you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam clenched his jaw. &#34;I&#39;ve already made it clear-take the money and leave. Don&#39;t make me say it again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia&#39;s voice trembled through the line, full of tears and desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Liam didn&#39;t care anymore. His relationship with Tricia had been nothing more than a careless fling.Now that Kayla was divorcing him over it, he was determined to cut ties completely. If getting rid of Tricia meant even the smallest chance of winning Kayla back, then he&#39;d do it.&#34;I&#39;ve already booked my flight,&#34; Tricia said through choked sobs. &#34;Can&#39;t you at least come see me off?Please,Liam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s face stayed cold. &#34;We&#39;ll see. I&#39;m busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up just in time to see Kayla step out of the director&#39;s office. Without hesitation, he ended the call and walked over. &#34;Is Marsha okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla glanced at him, her expression flat and cold.&#34;The director said she should be moved to a sunnier room. Getting sunlight every day will help her get better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll sort it out right away. I&#39;ll make sure she has the best room by tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need,&#34; Kayla said coldly, brushing past him.&#34;I&#39;ll take care of it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam followed close behind, clinging to her like a shadow she couldn&#39;t shake.&#34;It&#39;s alright. We&#39;re family -it shouldn&#39;t matter who handles it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Kayla got home, night had already fallen.Liam had driven her back and was still right behind her,stepping out of the car and trailing her as she made her way toward the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just pick a time to move back to the villa,&#34; he said.&#34;It&#39;s waiting for you-empty and quiet. It&#39;s your home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla came to a stop and turned around to face him head-on. &#34;Liam, do you really think I don&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing? You&#39;re only crawling back because l&#39;ve built a reputation at Newton Group. You want to use my connection with Archie to boost your company.Let me make this clear-you&#39;re wasting your time.I won&#39;t let you use me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam was stunned by her words. His face turned red.with embarrassment. &#34;But I love you. How can you throw away everything we&#39;ve been through?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave a cold, sharp laugh. &#34;I already let go of everything the day you cheated on me with Tricia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t look back. She turned and walked off,leaving Liam frozen in place, powerless to stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam stood there, frustrated and furious. With a clenched fist, he turned and slammed it down on the hood of his car. &#34;Kayla, I won&#39;t give up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at home, Kayla stepped into the shower and only afterward remembered her bag-she hadn&#39;t left it in Liam&#39;s car but in the meeting room at North Investment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While drying her hair in front of the mirror, she gently tapped her forehead. &#34;I can&#39;t believe I forgot my bag Now I have to face Jeremy again tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doorbell rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla quickly ran the towel through her hair once more and went to answer it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the door stood Jeremy&#39;s driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am, you left your bag at the office. Mr. Graham asked me to bring it to you,&#34; he said politely, handing it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla accepted the bag and walked back inside. From her balcony, she looked down and saw a sleek black car parked below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The back window lowered, and Jeremy looked up at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met, and for a second, something wordless passed between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s heartbeat quickened, a flutter echoing in her chest. Something strange stirred inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Jeremy rolled the window up, and the car pulled away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla remained on the balcony, stiff, watching until the car was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night when she went to bed, she had a long and vivid dream.</p>
