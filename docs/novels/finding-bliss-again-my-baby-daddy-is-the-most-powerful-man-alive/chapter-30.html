                <p>&#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s voice was as cold and commanding as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stepped inside, stopping a few feet from his desk. &#34;I heard you&#39;re having an allergic reaction. Is it serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy let out a soft scoff. &#34;So you do care about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla offered a polite smile. &#34;Of course. You&#39;re family, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy studied her closely-sweet face, the picture of innocence. But he knew better. She wore kindness like a mask, saving her edge for when it counted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, his arm beganto itch violently, and he reached to scratch it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t!&#34; Kayla stepped forward instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when she was a kid, she&#39;d had the same kind of reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t scratch-it&#39;ll spread and could get infected. Just wait for the ointment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy clenched his jaw and resisted the urge, forcing himself to endure the irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What triggered this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s mind raced. Then it hit her-the coffee Zoe had given her earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy had sipped the coffee. That was all it took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Same dirty tricks after all these years, Kayla thought bitterly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she&#39;d taken that cup, she&#39;d be the one scratching right now. &#34;Did you drink that coffee earlier?&#34; Kayla asked suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a sip,&#34; Jeremy replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a sip-and already a reaction. A whole cup could&#39;ve sent him to the ER.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy noticed. &#34;What are you thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shook her head quickly. &#34;Nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was no use accusing Zoe-not without proof. Jeremy would think she was just stirring trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Edwin returned with the ointment. &#34;Mr. Graham, the doctor said it&#39;s a skin allergy. You&#39;ll need to apply the ointment right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin began to help but was interrupted by a phone call. After a quick exchange, he turned back. &#34;Sir, Mr.Newton is leaving. Should we go see him off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy nodded. &#34;You go. I&#39;ll stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the ointment...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She can handle it,&#34; Jeremy said, glancing at Kayla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin hesitated, then left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla pointed at herself. &#34;Me? You want me to apply your ointment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without answering, Jeremy removed his jacket and unbuttoned his black shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Towering at six-foot-three, he revealed a chiseled frame-broad shoulders, a defined chest, lean muscle taut beneath his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla froze.Her ears turned red. Then Jeremy turned, baring his sculpted back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart skipped. Her cheeks flamed. And a warm drip landed on her lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She touched her face and paled. A nosebleed? Seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was so embarrassing. She couldn&#39;t even handle his back without bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the holdup?&#34; Jeremy, noticing her hesitation, began to glance over his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m doing it now!&#34; Kayla blurted out, pressing a hand to his back to keep him from turning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed a tissue, wiped her nose quickly, and forced herself to focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cool hand met his warm skin, and Jeremy tensed. A strange electricity passed between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shut his eyes and exhaled slowly. &#34;Just get it over with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right...here goes,&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla opened the tube and began applying the ointment with gentle strokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the soft light, their silhouettes merged-his tall, strong frame and her smaller, delicate form casting one shadow on the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night-the one she tried not to think about-had been too dark to see him clearly. But now,his perfection was impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat bloomed in her cheeks again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy, for his part, was trying to ignore the soft scent of her perfume-subtle but intoxicating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Kayla moved around to his front, still flustered, she said, &#34;Could you close your eyes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a reluctant sigh, Jeremy shut his eyes. Kayla&#39;s hands moved across his chest, light as feathers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door burst open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jeremy, where have you been? Hiding out in-whoa.&#34; Dewitt stopped in his tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla,crouched in front of Jeremy, jumped and dropped the tube. &#34;Sorry! Didn&#39;t mean to interrupt. I&#39;ll come back.&#34; Dewitt scratched his nose, already turning to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, why don&#39;t you help Jeremy with this?&#34; Kayla stood, blushing furiously. Without waiting for a response,she darted out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt blinked, watching her disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy opened his eyes, catching Dewitt&#39;s grin. &#34;What&#39;s so funny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt teased, &#34;Smooth, Jeremy. Flirting with your nephew&#39;s wife? You scared her out the door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked her to help apply some ointment,&#34; Jeremy said, casually buttoning his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt raised an eyebrow. &#34;You could&#39;ve asked anyone. She&#39;s Liam&#39;s wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re overthinking. It was just an ointment. Try finding a hobby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jeremy finished dressing and moved to leave, Dewitt called out with a teasing lilt, &#34;Still itching? Want me to call Kayla back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy shot him a warning glare.&#34;Get lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt chuckled, leaning against the desk, arms folded. &#34;Looks like the ice king&#39;s finally melting.&#34;</p>
