                <p>At Blossom Estate, Jeremy&#39;s private villa, the night air was pierced by Edwin&#39;s hurried footsteps as he entered, his expression anxious. &#34;Mr. Graham,your father went to Liam&#39;s place unexpectedly. He&#39;s been inside for over half an hour now and hasn&#39;t come out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy,fresh from his shower, sat at the coffee table in a jet-black bathrobe that emphasized his striking features. His long, deft fingers moved with practiced grace as he brewed a fresh pot of coffee, the deicate aroma swirling between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted his head, dark eyes glinting with quiet curiosity. &#34;My fathe&#39;s health has been fragile. He barely leaves the house these days. Why would he suddenly go out tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin relayed the details he&#39;d managed to uncover.&#34;I&#39;m not sure what Janiya said to him, but after speaking with her, he rushed out to see Liam. They&#39;re still over there. I&#39;ve also heard that Kayla is present.From what the servants are saying, there&#39;s shouting-possibly even a physical altercation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s hand stilled above the coffee pot, tension tightening his jaw, though he said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin pressed on, his tone more urgent.&#34;Do you want to check it out yourself? Janiya isn&#39;t exactlv known for her kindness. If she&#39;s stirring up trouble,your father could get caught in the middle. And Kayla is there by herself. She could be in real danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If my father wants to take Janiya&#39;s side, then so be it.It has nothing to do with me.&#34; Jeremy stood and strode back to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya rejoining the Graham family had stirred up nothing but discord. Most people hadn&#39;t welcomed her,and the tension between Jeremy and Johnny had only deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jeremy reached his doorway, Edwin piped up with another question. &#34;By the way, Zoe called today. She invited you to dinner tomorrow night. Should I accept on your behalf?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy halted for a moment, his hand resting on the doorknob. His mind had been so tangled with thoughts of Kayla lately that Zoe had nearly slipped from his memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a silent breath, wondering if he was starting to lose control. Zoe was the woman he was supposed to care about, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression eased a fraction as he nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll go to the dinner. Prepare a few decent gifts for me to take.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin dipped his head in acknowledgment. &#34;Got it,Mr.Graham.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Kayla approached Johnny, who fixed her with a gentle, almost grandfatherly look. &#34;Liam made a mistake, and it&#39;s only right he faces the consequences. Still,I&#39;ve heard about everything going on between you two. Now that you&#39;re finally together,don&#39;t throw around the word &#39;divorce&#39; so lightly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his words landed, Kayla immediately saw.through Janiya&#39;s ploy-she&#39;d called Johnny here just to stop the divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Janiya and Liam both put on their most innocent faces, as if she was the villain for not letting things go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla steadied herself with a quiet breath, then met Johnny&#39;s gaze head-on. &#34;Whatever happened between Liam and me can&#39;t be patched up. I&#39;m here for a divorce, and I&#39;d appreciate your support in that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny&#39;s expression darkened, clearly not expecting her to stand her ground so unflinchingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her chin, voice unwavering as she gestured toward the master bedroom. &#34;It&#39;s bad enough he cheated,but he even dared to bring the other woman into our home. You care about the Graham family&#39;s reputation, but why should I stay in a marriage that&#39;s already shattered?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from Janiya&#39;s and Liam&#39;s faces;neither dared to offer asingle excuse. At that tense moment, the sound of footsteps broke the silence as a doctor, guided by a servant,hurried in to tend to Tricia. Johnny, drawing on years of authority, straightened his posture and spoke in a voice edged with sincerity.&#34;Kayla, now that you&#39;re married, you&#39;re part of the Graham family. I&#39;ll make sure Liam makes it up to you for all he&#39;s put you through. Let&#39;s stop talking about divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t budge as she protested, &#34;Absolutely not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dismissive flick of his hand, Johnny brushed aside her refusal and pivoted to a new topic. &#34;That&#39;s not what brought me here tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s eyes lit up. &#34;Grandpa, whatever you need, just say the word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Johnny wasn&#39;t looking at his grandson. His attention fixed on Kayla, sharp and searching. &#34;I heard Jeremy&#39;s seeing your sister. What&#39;s the story there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s heart gave a startled jolt. She hadn&#39;t expected Johnny to bring up Jeremy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, she faltered. &#34;How would I know? I&#39;ve moved out of my father&#39;s place a long time ago.Zoe and I aren&#39;t close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny pressed on, refusing to lether dodge.&#34;Maybe you&#39;re not close, but you&#39;re still family.You must know something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam chimed in, &#34;Kayla, just be honest.Uncle Jeremy&#39;s over thirty and still single. Grandpa&#39;s worried abouthim.&#34;</p>
