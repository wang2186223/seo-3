                <p>I don&#39;t like owing people, so you better listen to me.&#34;.Jeremy pulled Kayla upright from the mattress,ignoring her protests. When she nearly lost her balance, his arm shot around her waist, catching her against him in a firm hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her top slipped in the process, a single strap falling off her shoulder to reveal a strip of delicate skin and the edge of her black bra.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed to her cheeks as she struggled to pull away. The more she tried, the further her shirt slid,drawing even more attention to her silhouette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s fingers flexed at her waist,tendons visible,clearly fighting to maintain control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they were so close that each breath mingled,and the air crackled with an electric tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy found himself staring at her lips, barely able to stop himself from leaning in. He silently cursed his lack of self-control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Jeremy, what&#39;s so urgent that you had to drag me all the way here?&#34; Footsteps echoed from outside,followed by Dewitt&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, Jeremy yanked a blanket over Kayla and  Pregnant settled her back onto the bed, making sure she was covered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still catching her breath, Kayla heard the door swing open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt stepped inside with a knowing grin. &#34;Did I just interrupt something spicy? Should I let you two finish?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s glare could have frozen fire. &#34;Come barging in like that again, and you&#39;ll leave with broken fingers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning innocence, Dewitt tucked his hands behind his back. &#34;Chill, man. You called about Kayla being hurt. Let me tae a look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped forward, but Jeremy blocked his path.&#34;You&#39;ve seen enough. Out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Man, what&#39;s with the attitude?&#34; Dewitt raised his palms in surrender, grinning sheepishly. &#34;Fine, I won&#39;t stare. But seriously, Jeremy, she&#39;s not even your girlfriend. Why do you care so much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s scowl only deepened. He looked seconds from tossing Dewitt out himself. &#34;You&#39;ve got one second to scram.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, alright! I&#39;m gone!&#34; Dewitt backpedaled,slipping out the door without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Dewitt disappeared,Jeremy followed right behind him. Kayla stayed put until she was certain the hallway was  Pregnant silent. Only then did she crawl out from beneath the blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still flustered, she gave her cheeks a gentle slap, then slipped on her shoes and padded quietly toward the door. Just as she cracked it open, she caught their voices drifting in from down the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s tone was sharp as a blade. &#34;That so-called server mistook me for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt&#39;s usual playfulness vanished, his voice growing more serious. &#34;It&#39;s a mess. Months ago, I was at a hotel after a business dinner and saw a college girl being harassed. She&#39;d been drugged and was completely out of it. I stayed the night to keep her safe. When her dad showed up, he jumped to conclusions, swore I&#39;d done something terrible. I tried to explain, even sent people to talk to him, but he wouldn&#39;t listen. He wants me locked up for good.I was too swamped to fight it, so I just let it go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy eyed him, not buying it just yet. &#34;That the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt looked genuinely exasperated. &#34;Come on, man.You think I&#39;d mess with a college girl? I&#39;m not that guy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s glare was nothing short of lethal, but he finally jerked his chin toward the lounge. &#34;He&#39;s in there.Fix things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt nodded toward the door to the bedroom.&#34;Kayla&#39;s alright,yeah? Want me to apologize in person?&#34; Jeremy&#39;s answer was silent-a cold, unblinking stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt just shrugged, hands raised in surrender.&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll stay out of it. Just cut her some slack. She took that knife for you, remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Dewitt slipped away, Jeremy made his way back into the room and spotted Kayla curled up on the couch, her face contorted in pain as she clutched her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly on edge, Jeremy rushed to her side.&#34;Where does it hurt? Tell me now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla tried to muster a smile, but her voice came out strained. &#34;It&#39;s nothing,really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was hoping the cramp would ease up, but the ache in her belly only grew sharper with each second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No more arguing-we&#39;re going to the hospital.&#34;Without waiting for her to object, Jeremy swept her into his arms and marched out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital, Jeremy flagged down a doctor and demanded Kayla be seen immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently set Kayla down on a hospital bed, fixing her with a stern look. &#34;Don&#39;t say a word. Let the professionals handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nurse rushed over, visibly anxious. &#34;Are you Mr.Graham?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy shot her a commanding look. &#34;Get the doctor ant here right now and make sure she&#39;s taken care of!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla wanted to protest, but her energy was shot.Panic bubbled up inside her as she clung to the bed rails, her heart pounding with dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla froze. They were about to find out she was pregnant!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Graham, I need you to wait outside. I&#39;ll take care of her exam.&#34; The doctor stepped in, mask on, and wheeled Kayla&#39;s bed into the exam room.</p>
