                <p>Isaac leaned in closer, his arm draped casually along the back of Kayla&#39;s chair, his grin widening with mischief. &#34;One glass? That&#39;s hardly enough. You should at least have three glasses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla lifted her glass with a playful raise of her brow.&#34;Sure. I&#39;ll drink as much as you do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac tapped his glass against hers and tossed the entire drink back in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While his head tilted back, Kayla quietly tipped her glass beneath the table, letting the liquid spill onto the floor without a trace. When he looked back at her, she flashed a bright smile and held up her now-empty glass.&#34;Finished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lsaac, completely fooled, lit up with enthusiasm. &#34;Then let&#39;s keep it going!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using the same trick, Kayla pretended to down a few more drinks. Meanwhile, the liquor began taking its toll on Isaac. His cheeks flushed, and his words grew looser as the alcohol crept through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s lips curled into a subtle smirk. It was time for her to get going. &#34;Mr. Brewer, if you&#39;ll excuse me,l need to visit the ladies&#39; room.&#34; She had barely started to rise when lsaac grabbed her arm and pulled her back into the seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand landed right where she was still sore, and she flinched at the sudden jab of pain. &#34;Not so fast,&#34; he slurred. &#34;You&#39;re not going anywhere until you finish this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He, clearly tipsy, poured another glass, filling it to the brim, and slid it in front of her, eyes fixed on her every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gàve him a sly smile. &#34;It&#39;s no fun if I&#39;m the only one drinking. Join me, won&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac wobbled his head, waving a finger at her face.&#34;| don&#39;t believe you can handle this much alcohol without getting drunk. This one&#39;s all yours. Bottoms up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sneaky bastard! Kayla cursed inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others at the table had started paying attention and joined in with laughter and taunts. &#34;Come on,Kayla! Don&#39;t let us down. Mr. Newton isn&#39;t here, so it&#39;s on you to hold his ground!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla leaned back slightly, putting on a look of casual confidence.&#34;Who said I wouldn&#39;t drink? It&#39;s just a bit of wine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up the glass and brought it to her lips. But just as it reached her mouth, her hand twitched-&#34;accidentally&#34;-and the entire contents spilled onto Isaac&#39;s lap. The deep red liquid soaked through his trousers, leaving a very obvious stain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right at that moment, Jeremy walked past the doorway of the private room. He stopped, his gaze landing sharply on the scene inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind him, Edwin remarked, &#34;I heard Mr. Newton was hosting a banquet tonight. Didn&#39;t expect Kayla to be in attendance too. Mr. Graham, should we go say hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t answer right away. He stood still, eyes narrowed,watching the room with quiet intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Isaac jumped to his feet, flustered and clearly humiliated. He tried shaking the wine from his clothes,but the stain only spread further. The red mark on his lap was impossible to ignore. &#34;What the hell&#39;s wrong with you?&#34; he snapped. &#34;You can&#39;t even hold a drink right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shot up from her seat, her expression a picture of panic. She snatched a stack of napkins from the table and rushed to lsaac&#39;s side, her voice shaky and full of regret. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry, Mr. Brewer! That was completely my fault. I didn&#39;t mean to. Please don&#39;t be upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jorge jumped in with a sneer. &#34;You need to be more careful. Look at his trousers-they&#39;re a mess. You think just saying sorry is enough to fix that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla blinked rapidly, her eyes glistening like she was on the verge of tears. Her face crumpled into a look so pitiful that it made her seem like she might fall apart any second. She looked very sorry. Isaac and Jorge exchanged uncertain glances. The fight in them fizzled-neither wanted to be seen ganging up on a woman who looked that devastated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac finally let out a heavy sigh and waved her off,reaching for a cloth to drape over the stain. &#34;Forget it.I&#39;ll go change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he stepped out of the room, the corners of Kayla&#39;s mouth curved into a quiet, victorious smile-hidden just well enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she didn&#39;t know was that Jeremy had seen the whole thing. Leaning just outside the room, his eyes following her every move. There was a faint smirk on his face. She really knew how to play her cards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Archie returned from taking a call and noticed Jeremy nearby. He looked surprised.&#34;Jeremy! If you&#39;re free, why don&#39;t you come in and have a drink with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy glanced at him briefly, then stepped into the room without saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Kayla saw him walk in, her smile vanished.Her eyes dropped to the floor to avoid making eye contact with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t miss a beat. As he passed her, his eyes landed on her for a split second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s heart pounded in her chest. She&#39;d been a breath away from slipping out unnoticed. Of all times,why did he have to walk in now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie clapped his hands. &#34;Well then! Since Jeremy is here, let&#39;s all raise a glass and give a proper toast!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, Isaac and Jorge straightened up like schoolboys caught misbehaving. Gone was the earlier bravado-they nodded quickly, all too eager to show respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla scoffed to herself. What a bunch of spineless old bullies!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the glasses were lifted, Jeremy&#39;s smooth, deep voice cut through the air, directed at her with a subtle edge. &#34;Kayla, won&#39;t you be joining us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla reached for the bottle of juice beside her,intending to pour herself a drink quietly. But Jeremy&#39;s voice came again-subtle enough to sting. &#34;What&#39;s the matter? No more wine? Or has Archie run out of money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jab was clear. This wasn&#39;t juice hour-he expected real wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s mind went into overdrive. Her little tricks wouldn&#39;t fly here. Jeremy wasn&#39;t the type to be fooled by a spilled drink or a staged accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could say anything, Archie jumped in,trying to ease the tension. &#34;I&#39;ll take this one for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jeremy didn&#39;t even look his way. His eyes stayed locked on Kayla. &#34;Her drink should be taken by herself.&#34;</p>
