                <p>The tension between Kayla and Jeremy snapped the second he spoke. Whatever spark had lingered fizzled instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered and clearly annoyed, Kayla muttered,&#34;You&#39;ve got the wrong idea. I just tripped. That&#39;s all.You can let go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy knew he was pushing boundaries, but something about holding her-her warmth,her weight in his arms-made him hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time he touched Kayla, that strange, nagging feeling returned. He had a feeling that she was the woman from that night. But that wasn&#39;t possible,was it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts were tangled, and for once, he couldn&#39;t think straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla tried to break free, but his grip didn&#39;t loosen.Frustrated, she stomped hard on his foot. The sharp pain made Jeremy flinch, and she took the chance to shove him away and put some distance between them.&#34;Don&#39;t cross the line!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the warmth of her body left his arms, the intensity in Jeremy&#39;s eyes faded. He stared at her. &#34;Every time you see me,you panic like a deer in headlights. Why?&#34; Kayla&#39;s heart thudded against her ribs, but she kept her tone steady. &#34;Your reputation precedes you. I&#39;ve heard what kind of man you are-direct, ruthless. In Trark,you hold power. It&#39;s only natural to be wary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a decent answer. But something about her explanation was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well. There you are. I went to the hospital,but none of you were there.&#34; Dewitt&#39;s voice cut through the moment. He strolled in casually, dripping confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a sharp, tailored gray jacket, his hair slicked back with precision, pulling off the look of a smooth operator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sudden entrance shattered the tension. Kayla gave him a polite nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt grinned. &#34;Kayla got hurt because of me. I&#39;m here to apologize properly. I&#39;ve got a VIP lounge at Nightfall waiting for us. Drinks on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nightfall was Dewitt&#39;s pride and joy. The kind of place where money flew like paper and everyone acted like they ruled the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla didn&#39;t miss a beat. &#34;Thanks, but I&#39;m heading home early tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt clutched his chest like she&#39;d shot him. &#34;That hurts. Come on, let me make it up to you. I&#39;ll get you anything you want. Name it-moon, stars, you got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla crossed her arms. &#34;You&#39;re laying it on thick. Not buying it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy suddenly chimed in, &#34;Dewitt doesn&#39;t hand out invites for no reason. He&#39;s being serious. If you walk away, it won&#39;t look good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla hesitated. With Jeremy backing Dewitt,refusing again would just come off as rude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt clapped his hands. &#34;Great. Car&#39;s ready. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla followed Dewitt out. Jeremy stayed behind for a moment, his eyes drifting to the piano in the corner of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin stepped up beside him. &#34;Sir, it&#39;s strange. That piece Kayla played-hardly anyone knows it. Could mean something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy was thinking about how Kayla had avoided his eyes earlier, like she was hiding something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Edwin. &#34;Run the check again.Everything about the woman from that night-I want it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin blinkedd. &#34;We&#39;ve already checked. It was Zoe.You want me to keep digging?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s voice stayed calm and steady. &#34;Just keep digging.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The VIP lounge at Nightfall was everything you&#39;d</p>
                
                
                
                <p>expect-plush leather seats, flashing lights, shelves full of high-end liquor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Music thumped through the walls. A couple of women in bunny ears were dancing on stage, trying to catch attention and earn tips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt looked completely at home, cracking jokes with a few business buddies while the drinks kept coming without pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla sat on the edge of the couch, quietly sipping water. The atmosphere wasn&#39;t her thing, and she couldn&#39;t wait to leave. Ten more minutes-just enough to be polite-then she was out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A drunken man stumbled into the room and locked eyes on her, grinning like he&#39;d struck gold. &#34;Hey,beautiful,&#34; he slurred. &#34;What&#39;s with the water? Come have a drink with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla leaned back a bit, the heavy stench of whiskey on his breath making her stomach churn. Forcing a tight smile, she said, &#34;I don&#39;t drink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed and pointed a wobbly finger. &#34;Come on,don&#39;t be shy. Just one. Hell, I&#39;ll give you a million if you say yes.&#34; His eyes slid down her body,stopping at her chest. Kayla&#39;s stomach turned. She took a step back.&#34;Seriously. I don&#39;t drink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped, slimy and aggressive. &#34;You&#39;re in a place like this, dressed like that? Stop pretending you&#39;re different.&#34; Then he grabbed a glass and tried to press it into her hand, the other arm snaking behind her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Jeremy stepped through the door. His expression darkened the second he saw what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| said no!&#34; Kayla shouted, shoving the man off her.The glass slipped and shattered on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy&#39;s mood shifted fast. &#34;Ungrateful bitch!&#34; He raised his hand to slap her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he never got the chance. Jeremy&#39;s hand caught his wrist mid-swing. The man gasped,his arm frozen in place, pain flashing across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy twisted hard and flung him against the wall.&#34;Get out.&#34;</p>
