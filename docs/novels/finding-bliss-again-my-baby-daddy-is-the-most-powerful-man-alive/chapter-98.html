                <p>Johnny slammed his hand against the table, the sharp sound cutting through the chaos as he coughed and steadied his voice. &#34;Enough. Liam, have that trending topic removed. Right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam hesitated, shifting uncomfortably as his gaze flicked toward Jeremy, who watched the scene unfold with an infuriating smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shoulders tense, Liam muttered, &#34;It&#39;s already gone viral-hundreds of thousands of shares. Uncle Jeremy,l can&#39;t do this alone. I need your help to take it down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t answer. He reclined in his chair, legs crossed, toying with his ring as if the crisis didn&#39;t concern him in the slightest. His face was unreadable, eyes sharp and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya cut in, &#34;Jeremy, you could make this disappear with a single call. Every minute it stays up, the Graham name takes another hit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny turned to Jeremy, knowing he was the only one powerful enough to bury the story. For a moment,the room held its breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy finally raised his cold gaze to meet Johnny&#39;s. His words came out measured and deadly. &#34;Back then,you cheated on my mom. The paparazzi caught you red-handed. I remember-you didn&#39;t even try to stop the story. You used it-flaunted your mistress, paid for puff pieces about your &#39;great love.&#39; My mom never recovered. That scandal destroyed her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words landed like a blow, and Johnny&#39;s face twisted in shame as old wounds split open in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla, watching the exchange, felt a chill snake up her spine. She&#39;d known Johnny had a hand in Jeremy&#39;s mother&#39;s death, but hearing the sordid details spelled out made her stomach turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driving his wife to an early grave for a mistress? That was beyond heartless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya stepped up to defend Johnny. &#34;Jeremy, you&#39;ve got the wrong idea. Dad was overwhelmed back then -he didn&#39;t mean to let things get out of hand. What happened to your mom wasn&#39;t his fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s cold stare cut her off, leaving her stiff and silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tense quiet filled the room before Jeremy finally glanced at Kayla. &#34;Regardless, I support Kayla&#39;s decision to divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla blinked in surprise, caught off guard that Jeremy would take her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy sipped his coffee, eyes fixed on the cup, pretending his support was nothing noteworthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya hurried to smooth things over. &#34;Alright. Tomorrow, they&#39;ll go get the divorce settled. Jeremy, can you handle that trending topic now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s face went ashen, and he blurted out, &#34;Mom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya silenced him with a sharp look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Burdened with guilt, Johnny turned to Kayla, his tone gentler. &#34;Kayla, I know things with Liam haven&#39;t been easy. You two should end this without any more trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Kayla wanted to leap for joy, but she masked her excitement behind a calm, polite smile for Jeremy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy turned away, ice in his eyes,barely acknowledging Kayla&#39;s silent thanks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, Janiya dragged Liam back to his room and shut the door behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the latch clicked, Liam snapped, hurling anything within reach before turning his fury on Janiya. &#34;You told me not to get divorced; now you&#39;re the one forcing me! Mom, what&#39;s going on with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patience wearing thin, Janiya gave his forehead a pointed tap. &#34;Use your head for once. You had no other move today. Jeremy backed Kayla in front of everyone. If you hadn&#39;t gone along, Perennia Group would be crawling with reporters by sunrise, and you&#39;d be their next headline. Don&#39;t say I never warned you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shoulders slumped, Liam sank into the chair, irritation spreading across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janiya eyed him with a scornfuI tilt of her head. &#34;I told you-if you wanted to keep using Kayla&#39;s social circle,you should&#39;ve stayed away from Tricia. But you couldn&#39;t help yourself, could you?&#34; Liam opened his mouth to argue but clamped it shut, knowing he&#39;d fallen for Tricia&#39;s charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing by the window, arms folded and lips twisting into a sly smile, Janiya added, &#34;Kayla isn&#39;t walking away from this marriage just yet. The court won&#39;t grant it so soon. Anything could happen in that time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy shadow crossed Liam&#39;s face as Janiya&#39;s words sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Kayla stepped out of the house with a lightness in her stride, heart fluttering at the prospect of freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice like ice slíced through her giddiness. &#34;You seem pleased. No plans to party tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze, her smile faltering as she turned. &#34;Thank you for helping me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy sauntered closer, hands tucked in his pockets, eyes assessing her. &#34;Nicely played. You knew my father&#39;s weak spot was his precious reputation. Stir up the press and corner Janiya and Liam into agreeing to the divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla lifted her gaze, feigning wide-eyed innocence. &#34;That&#39;s not it. Liam started this mess. I just defended myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth was, she&#39;d never intended to force Johnny&#39;s hand so brutally. But when Liam went after her mother&#39;s grave, she couldn&#39;t hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s voice softened, though his gaze remained sharp. &#34;Getting that story trending wasn&#39;t luck. You need connections to pull strings like that. Funny thing is, you&#39;re supposed to be friendless here in Trark.Guess you&#39;re more resourceful than you let on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s pulse quickened. She let out a nervous laugh and shrugged innocently. &#34;I don&#39;t know what you mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s lips curled in a knowing smirk as he turned to his car.&#34;Want a ride?&#34;</p>
