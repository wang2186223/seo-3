                <p>Colorful confetti fluttered down all around Kayla,dusting her hair and shoulders in a sparkling cascade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flinched instinctively, squeezing her eyes shut But when she realized it was only the aftermath of a confetti cannon, she snapped them open and fixed Liam with a sharp glare. &#34;Have you lost your mind?Maybe you need to get your head examined!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam, who&#39;d been moping just moments before,suddenly straightened, a hopeful glint sparking in his eyes. He hurried out of the car to stand beside her.&#34;Kayla, I brought you here tonight because I owe you an honest apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s patience snapped. &#34;Liam, is making a fool out of me your new hobby?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could stalk away, the restaurant doors swung open. The staff, dressed in cheerful, party-bright uniforms, filed out in a procession, each carrying a single vibrant rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla huffed in disbelief, shaking confetti from her hair and darted straight for the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t go yet. Let&#39;s just have dinner, all right?&#34; Liam grabbed her arm and steered her inside, leaving her no chance to protest. He&#39;d booked out the entire restaurant for the evening,decorating it with streamers and fresh flowers. The long table in the center sparkled beneath the lights,covered with an extravagant array of dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No drama tonight, okay? Just relax and enjoy the meal,&#34; Liam insisted, grinning as he piled slices of tender meat onto her plate with almost childlike enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rich aroma hit Kayla like a wall, turning her stomach. She pressed a hand to her lips, fighting back a surge of nausea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is your favorite dish, isn&#39;t it? Eat up tonight-l ordered extra for you.&#34; Liam, oblivious, beamed as he ladled a generous helping into her bowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of the glossy, fatty meat made Kayla&#39;s stomach revolt. She bolted upright and darted toward the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, the servers scrambled aside as she brushed past, her heels clicking urgently across the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liamn gaped after her, stunned by her abrupt reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A waiter, hesitant but curious, leaned over and whispered,&#34;Sir, could it be that your wife is expecting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s face hardened. &#34;That&#39;s ridiculous,&#34; he snapped,his voice laced with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had never shared a bed. How could she possibly he preanant? Yet,retching was certainly something that could hint at pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm cloud passed across Liam&#39;s features as he began to entertain the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the restroom, Kayla leaned over the sink,heaving until the wave of nausea finally ebbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She splashed cold water on her face, staring at her reflection-her eyes clouded with worry. The sudden bout of sickness rattled her. Had Liam noticed anything unusual?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steadying herself, she gripped her purse, drew in a deep breath, and strode back toward the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam glanced at her anxiously. &#34;Kayla, are you not feeling well?&#34; he asked, concern etched into his brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a measured calm, Kayla set a small box of medicine on the table and eased into her seat. &#34;My stomach&#39;s been acting up. Greasy food just doesn&#39;tsit well with me right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flickered across Liam&#39;s face as he spotted the box-her explanation put his worries to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately turned the lighter dishes in her direction, eager to please. &#34;Here, try some of these instead. I shouldn&#39;t have ordered so many heavy dishes tonight. Next time, I&#39;ll be more careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla lifted her fork and poked at her food, feigning a few polite bites. Every so often, she watched him from beneath her lashes, making sure he wouldn&#39;t catch on to her charade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to bridge the growing distance between them,Liam reached for an old memory. &#34;Kayla, remember those food stalls we used to visit? The grilled fish was your favorite. The owner&#39;s opened up a proper restaurant now. He invited us over the other day.What do you say I take you there tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But nostalgia had lost its power over Kayla. Whatever warmth she once felt for him had long since cooled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, her voice quiet but resolute.&#34;Work&#39;s keeping me busy these days. You should go without me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unwilling to give up, Liam pressed on with a hint of forced optimism. &#34;Then I&#39;ll just wait until you have time.Newton Group&#39;s such a big company-they must treat their employees well. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll give you some days off eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s icy stare lingered on him, her lips pressed into a thin line as she said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then,Liam&#39;s phone started to buzz on the table,vibrating insistently. He glanced at the screen,his jaw tensing when he saw Tricia&#39;s name flashing. With a quick swipe,he silenced the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the phone went still, it started ringing again. Irritated, Liam snatched up the device and stood, muttering, &#34;It&#39;s work. Eat without me. I&#39;ll be back in a minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla caught the lie instantly. She let out a faint,derisive smirk, too weary to bother exposing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping away, Liam asked in a low, scolding voice,&#34;Tricia, do you have any idea what I&#39;m dealing with right now? Why are you calling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Tricia&#39;s trembling voice spilled through the line. &#34;Liam, I slipped in your bathroom. I&#39;m bleeding.Please,can you come home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pinched the bridge of his nose, frustration flickering across his face. &#34;I can&#39;t leave now. Go to the hospital. Get someone to help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it really hurts!&#34; Tricia sobbed, her cries growing louder as a servant&#39;s muffled reassurances sounded in the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gritting his teeth, Liam relented, snapping,&#34;Fine.Stay there. I&#39;m on my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned, mentally scrambling for an excuse. But before he could even speak, Kayla looked up at him,her gaze sharp and unyielding. &#34;Since when has Tricia been living in our house?&#34;</p>
