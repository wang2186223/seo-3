                <p>A stunned silence took hold of Kayla, her eyes widening with a mixture of fear and confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the flicker of panic in her expression, Jeremy&#39;s harsh exterior melted ever so slightly before he let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting a second, Kayla slid away toward the window, her fingers absently massaging her sore jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just need answers about Perennia Group. That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determination radiated from her voice, making it clear she wouldn&#39;t back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loosening his tie,Jeremy kept his face impassive. &#34;Edwin&#39;s people found a mess-phony investors, cooked financials, and some serious tax evasion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re kidding! That can&#39;t be true!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Signs of trouble had always haunted the back of her mind, especially with Liam so desperate for North Investment&#39;s support, but this revelation felt much darker than she ever expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,she realized just how badly Liam had botched things, crossing the line into illegal territory for a quick profit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A folder landed in her lap as Jeremy tossed it over. &#34;If you don&#39;t believe me, have a look for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Papers rustled as Kayla flipped through the folder, eyes racing over line after line of damning evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood drained from her cheeks as Jeremy continued, &#34;Trying to reclaim Cooper Group? I wouldn&#39;t bother. There&#39;s nothing left to save.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every asset had been stripped. Liam hadn&#39;t just mismanaged-he&#39;d bled Cooper Group dry, leaving only debts behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock hit Kayla so hard she could barely breathe. m to ruin everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unreadable look crossed Jeremy&#39;s face as he watched her reaction. &#34;Liam&#39;s been busy, hasn&#39;t he? Even if you get it back, Cooper Group is worthless now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That company is my mother&#39;s legacy. I don&#39;t care how bad things are. I&#39;m taking it back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intensity in her voice caught Jeremy&#39;s attention, making him study her a moment longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek estate came into view as the car glided to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twisting around, Edwin said, &#34;We&#39;ve arrived, Mr. Graham.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll leave you to your meeting, then,&#34; Kayla said, reaching for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could step out, an assistant approached, offering a quick update. &#34;Mr. Graham, Mr. Nicolson wanted you to know that Mr. Newton&#39;s already inside and waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr.Newton?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla paused-one foot hung in the air before she slid back into the seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; Jeremy nodded, catching the look on her face. &#34;Was there something you wanted to ask?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity piqued, Kayla leaned in and asked, &#34;Are you talking about the president of Newton Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From what she&#39;d read in the reports, it looked like Liam had put Cooper Group up as collateral with Newton Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If her hunch was correct, getting close to Mr. Newton could be her only way forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion flickered in Jeremy&#39;s gaze as he seemed to size up her motives. With a slight nod,he said,&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not missing a beat, Kayla offered him a bright smile. &#34;Since you&#39;re still recovering, let me walk you in. You could use an extra hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resourcefulness shone through-Kayla wasn&#39;t about to let this opportunity slip by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Jeremny offered no response, Kayla plowed ahead. &#34;Decision made. I&#39;m coming with you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A barely-there smirk touched Edwin&#39;s lips. Very few people dared to steamroll Jeremy like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their destination loomed ahead-a private golf course known for catering to the city&#39;s most powerful players.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfectly trimmed lawns and impeccable staff sent a clear message: this was a sanctuary for the ultra-wealthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the servers met them at the entrance, her greeting polished and warm.&#34;Welcome, Mr.Graham.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes landed on Kayla, and the smile widened. &#34;Mrs. Graham, it&#39;s good to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange hush seemed to settle in the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was Mrs. Graham, but was not Jeremy&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually,I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She isn&#39;t my wife!&#34; Jeremy cut her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; the server said, her expression sheepish as she ushered them forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the manicured lawns, clusters of men in designer suits laughed and talked among themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt stood out from the crowd, an arm slung casually around a pretty young woman while he chatted with a striking man beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That striking man, Kayla guessed, had to be Mr. Newton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jeremy! Took you long enough. We&#39;ve been dying of boredom,&#34; Dewitt called out. His eyes then landed on Kayla,lighting up with mischief.&#34;Kayla!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Archie Newton offered Jeremy a firm handshake before giving Kayla an inquisitive once-over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than introduce Kayla, Jeremy left the silence stretching, making no move to break it. Dewitt cleared his throat, jumping in to fill the awkward gap. &#34;This is Kayla. Her husband is Jeremy&#39;s nephew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla caught Archie&#39;s gaze, which lingered a moment longer before he smiled. &#34;Archie Newton. Nice to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nlice to meet you too.&#34; Kayla smiled sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not missing a beat, Dewitt shot Archie a look. &#34;You might not know Kayla personally, but I&#39;m sure you know her husband,Liam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confidence radiated from Kayla as she stepped forward, her chin held high. &#34;Actually, I&#39;m divorcing Liam,so there&#39;s no need to link us. Mr. Newton, I understand you&#39;ve had some business with Perennia Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth replaced formality in Archie&#39;s reply, his presence more inviting than Jeremy&#39;s ever was. &#34;That&#39;s right. I&#39;ve been out of the country, though, so my deputy oversaw most of the dealings. Today&#39;s meeting is really about catching up with Jeremy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see.&#34; Processing this, Kayla&#39;s mind worked overtime, searching for the right opening to discuss Cooper Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dewitt let go of his companion and leaned toward Jeremy, teasing, &#34;Bringing family to work now, huh?You&#39;re setting quite the example.&#34;</p>
