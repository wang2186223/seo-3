                <p>Jeremy towered above everyone else, his height impossible to ignore There was something about him,a quiet intensity, polished and powerful Even without trying, he drew every pair of eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a sleek black suit that spoke of quiet luxury,every detail immaculate. His face was flawless-strikingly handsome, yet distant</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla caught her breath. The sight of him made her freeze. He was too striking Too composed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jeremy&#39;s gaze brushed over her, her heart skipped and she dropped her eyes instinctively</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, his eyes moved on, and he walked off with his entourage, each step unhurried</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam finally managed to park the car, though he had to squeeze it in near a reeking bin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, shall we go in?&#34; he asked, extending his hand to her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a step back, her tone cool &#34;I&#39;ll be fine on my own.&#34; He hesitated but held himself back. Causing a scene here wasn&#39;t worth it. &#34;Alright,&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The family banquet passed without Jeremy making an appearance. Kayla&#39;s shoulders loosened just a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had been there, she would&#39;ve been a wreck,unable to sit still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she excused herself to the bathroom, she didn&#39;t actually go inside. Instead, she slipped out into the garden,craving air and distance</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The main hall buzzed with conversation and music,but out here, the quiet pressed in from all sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything about this estate reeked of power-wealth carved into marble paths and whispering fountains. No wonder Liam had tried so desperately to claw his way back.Who wouldn&#39;t?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla let her feet lead the way. Soon,she realized she didn&#39;t know where she was anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eventually stumbled upon a pond, where she suddenly heard a commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man was being hauled over by two bodyguards, his head shoved beneath the surface of the pond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He screamed in panic, swearing he didn&#39;t know  anything, his voice cracking with fear</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More bodyguards surrounded them-at least a dozen their black uniforms like shadows</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla dove behind a bush and clasped a hand over her mouth, her heart pounding like it wanted to escape her chest</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They only dragged the man out when he was seconds from drowning, then hurled him onto the ground like he was nothing more than trash</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Graham. I swear, I don&#39;t know who was in the room that night! I didn&#39;t see anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the bodyguards slammed a fist into his face &#34;Still pretending you don&#39;t know?&#34; he growled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear, I don&#39;t! I nodded off-I didn&#39;t see anything,l promisel&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a loud crack His scream echoed off the stone One of his fingers had just been snapped clean</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s entire body went stiff She felt cold, sweat clinging to her skin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy was the man from that night And he was clearly looking for answers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant he didn&#39;t know she was the woman from  that night</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of fear surged through Kayla, tangled with a thin thread of relief She had to get out Now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she turned to slip away, two bodyguards stepped into her path</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s someone here,&#34; one of them said sharply</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla froze and forced a smile &#34;I was just passing by I didn&#39;t see anything, I swear&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin Bailey, Jeremy&#39;s assistant, gave her a quck assessing look before turning his head and sald, &#34;Mr Graham, it&#39;s Liam&#39;s wife</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silence followed Then, a deep, smooth voice answered,&#34;Bring her here &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Kayla could react, they grabbed her She was hauled forward and shoved so roughly she stumbled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her throat tightened as she stood, head bowed, too frightened to meet his eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was lounging on a chaise longue A black V-neck clung to his frame, and his loose, tailored trousers hung just right. The lighting veiled part of his face,but what was visible looked like a masterpiece</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his eyes found her She looked so small standing there Fragile, even Her long lashes trembled,her fear plain in every movement Something about her vulnerability seemed to stir something faint in him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look up,&#34; he said, voice low but firm</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla clutched her dress in tight fists. She bit her lip before slowly lifting her gaze</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked His expression gave away nothing &#34;Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got lost,&#34; she whispered &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to interrupt anything&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lost?&#34; His tone was icy. &#34;Or did Liam send you to sniff around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nol Absolutely not! I swear!&#34; She raised her hand as if taking an oath, but his stare remained cool, unmoved</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, he didn&#39;t push the issue. With a flick of his hand, he signaled the guards to let her go</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over her, but she only managed a few shaky steps before her stomach twisted violently The nausea surged out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spotted a bin near his chaise longue and rushed toward it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her balance faltered-she slipped, missed the  edge, and fell hard against him, collapsing into his arms as she retched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbelievable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguards jolted in surprise and rushed forward,ready to pull her off him without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy&#39;s face darkened. He lifted a hand, halting them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gagged a few more times against his chest before the wave of nausea passed. Thankfully,nothing came up. It was just dry heaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed her off, his jaw tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Liam send you to seduce me?&#34; His voice was sharp,laced with ice and barely contained fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla landed on the ground, disoriented, and blinked up at him. &#34;I wasn&#39;t feeling well. I&#39;m sorry. You won&#39;t blame me, right? We&#39;re family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy furrowed his brow. This woman was clever-she knew how to exploit the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light shifted, catching her face in fuL. She looked pale and scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll leave now,&#34; she mumbled, starting to rise.&#34;Goodbye, Jeremy.&#34; But she hadn&#39;t made it far before his hand closed around her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes locked onto hers again-sharp, unblinking, as if he could see past the trembling exterior</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s chest tightened. Did he know? Had he seen her face that night?</p>
