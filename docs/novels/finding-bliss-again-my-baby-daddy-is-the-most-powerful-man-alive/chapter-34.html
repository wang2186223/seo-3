                <p>Liam pressed his lips against Kayla&#39;s ear and murmured without a hint of shame,&#34;Just play along, will you?|need to discuss business with Mr. Campbell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shot him a look of pure disbelief. &#34;And why would I do you that favor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, he couldn&#39;t stop using her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of backing off, Liam pulled her closer until there was barely any space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped to a hushed murmur.&#34;lntroduce me to Mr. Campbell. If I can close a deal with him tonight, I&#39;ll agree to any one condition you name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla arched an eyebrow, not missing a beat. &#34;Even a divorce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s jaw tensed. For a moment, he looked ready to argue, but then, he nodded. &#34;Yes. Even that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, cynical laugh slipped from Kayla&#39;s lips. &#34;Afte everything, you think I&#39;d actually buy that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam faltered, then tried again, his tone gentling, almost coaxing. &#34;Kayla, Perennia Group is ours-something we built together from scratch. All this success,it should mean something to both of us. Even if you&#39;re not in charge anymore, we&#39;re still married. We&#39;re still a team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla had heard it all before. Empty promises, recycled assurances-none of it moved her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, the pair looked like a couple sharing a tender moment, locked in each other&#39;s arms,their closeness painting a perfect illusion for anyone watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy watched the entire exchange from across the room, swirling his wine with an air of detached interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing beside him, Edwin glanced at his boss before commenting.&#34;Looks like Kayla and Liam have patched things up.&#34; &#34;Stay out of it!&#34; Jeremy snapped, then pivoted and strode off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin stayed behind, his brow furrowed in confusion. What was Jeremy thinking when he told him that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>if it wasn&#39;t his concern, why had Jeremy been staring at Kayla for so long, ignoring everyone else who tried to greet him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side of the room, Liam wasted no time dragging Kayla into his schemes, eagerly drawing Zane into friendly banter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to say, your husband&#39;s quite the catch. You two look made for each other.&#34; Zane and his wife smiled at Kayla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. Kayla and I go way back-we were each other&#39;s first love. Five years together, and we&#39;ve always been inseparable.&#34; As he spoke, Liam tried once more to pull Kayla into an embrace. But she nimbly sidestepped his arm, slipping just out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam laughed off her evasiveness without a trace of embarrassment.′′She′Sa little shy when it comes to public displays of affection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Campbell couple chuckled, convinced Kayla and Liam were the picture of marital bliss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam seized the moment, eager to ingratiate himself.&#34;Mr.Campbell, why don&#39;t we head over there and have a real conversation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the smug curve of Liam&#39;s lips, Kayla fought the urge to wipe that expression off his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath his polished facade, he was a complete fraud, always performing for an audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmuring a polite excuse, Kayla slipped from the group and made her way toward the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the door closed behind her, she gripped the edge of the sink and drew a shaky breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in her body felt off, a subtle unease twisting in her stomach. Maybe it was the sliver of cake she&#39;d nibbled on earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at her reflection in the mirror: delicate features, lips with a natural blush, teeth bright as pearls. But the eyes that met her gaze were clouded with uncertainty, a shadow of confusion flickering in their depths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam would never agree to a divorce without a fight. How much longer would this exhausting battle drag on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After collecting herself, Kayla smoothed her hair and stepped out of the restroom. As she crossed the garden, a familiar silhouette caught her eye-a lone figure seated in the pavilion ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she wanted to reach her destination, she would have to pass by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla faltered for a moment, uneasy about seeming impolite by not greeting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could make up&#39;her mind, a woman in a blush-pink dress strolled over to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla froze mid-step and quietly slipped back into the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe, curves accentuated by her designer dress and expensive handbag swinging from her wrist, greeted Jeremy with practiced charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was honeyed, her smile deliberately sweet. &#34;Jeremy, I really appreciate you inviting me tonight.Everyone&#39;s been so welcoming. I&#39;ve already made some new friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy looked her way, cool and unreadable, but he didn&#39;t rebuff her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to Edwin&#39;s thorough investigation, he was nearly certan this woman was the same one from that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That alone compelled him to treat her with more consideration than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Zoe asked him to bring her to the banquet, Jeremy hadn&#39;t hesitated. He saw it as a matter of responsibility-something he couldn&#39;t shirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are plenty of people worth knowing here,&#34; he replied, his voice even but distant. &#34;Networking&#39;s important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe spotted a bottle of wine on the table and moved closer, her movements fluid and calculated. &#34;Thank you for this opportunity.&#34; As she poured him a glass, the deep V of her dress dipped, offering an unobstructed view of her delicate collarbones and the alluring line of her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aware of Jeremy&#39;s distaste for overpowering fragrances, Zoe had deliberately chosen a rose-scented bath earlier, leaving her skin with only the faintest trace of roses-a gentle, natural aroma that lingered softly in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The subtle scent wrapped the space in a soothing warmth, barely noticeable, yet undeniably pleasant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet when Jeremy showed no reaction at all, Zoe grew uneasy, worrying the scent might be too light. She subtly closed the distance between them,hoping he&#39;d notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s really no need to lean in just to pour me a drink,&#34; Jeremy remarked, his tone calm but unmistakably distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe drew back immediately, her eyes lowered in compliance. &#34;I know you&#39;re always busy. That&#39;s why l treasure every moment I get to spend by your side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy didn&#39;t answer, absently swirling the wine in his glass, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing an opening, Zoe pressed on. &#34;My parents have been hoping to invite you to dinner. They wanted to apologize for last time-when our meal got cut short so unexpectedly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The previous dinner had ended poorly due to Kayla&#39;s unexpected arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe fidgeted anxiously, her heart thudding as she waited for Jeremy&#39;s answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few seconds of silence, he nodded. &#34;You can set it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright smile broke across Zoe&#39;s face. &#34;Thank you. My parents will be over the moon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, Kayla caught every word. She couldn&#39;t help but sneer inwardly-Jeremy had completely fallen for Zoe&#39;s act, convinced she was the woman from that night. Zoe wasn&#39;t shy about seizing the opportunity; she and her mother really were experts when it came to manipulation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Kayla mulled it over, Jeremy&#39;s deep voice interrupted her thoughts. &#34;Zoe, do you remember what happened that night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s fingers hesitated over the fruit she was peeling, a flicker of unease passing through her eyes.&#34;Why are you suddenly asking about that night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t want to answer?&#34; Jeremy&#39;s brow furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe looked away, lowering her head as if bashful, her fingertips toying nervously with the hem of her dress.&#34;Oh,that night...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy probed further, his gaze unwavering.&#34;Wat happened that night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face grew even redder. &#34;You were so passionate that I could hardly walk the next day.&#34;</p>
