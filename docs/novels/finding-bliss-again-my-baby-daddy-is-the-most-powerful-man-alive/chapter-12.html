                <p>&#34;What are you doing? Let me go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the hospital, Kayla jerked her arm free, her face twisted in disgust. She rubbed her wrist, the spot where Liam&#39;s fingers had clamped down still sore with a dull ache</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s expression tightened, a flicker of anger breaking through his usually composed face. He hadn&#39;t expected her to actually approach Jeremy about the collaboration. Was she really that serious about ending their marriage?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held back the rising frustration in his chest. &#34;Uncle Jeremy isn&#39;t easy to deal with, and you&#39;ve injured him He&#39;s not someone you want as an enemy Just let it go -I&#39;ll handle the collaboration. Just stop bringing up the divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla should&#39;ve felt something-gratitude,maybe-but there was only cold detachment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her head, her voice ice-cold. &#34;I said I&#39;d handle it, and I will. Once it&#39;s done, we&#39;re getting divorced. I&#39;m sticking to my word, so don&#39;t interfere.&#34; Liam&#39;s eyes narrowed, his voice low with disbelief.&#34;And how exactly do you plan on getting him to agree?You went there today and came back empty-handed.If 1, his nephew, couldn&#39;t convince him, what makes you think you can?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla took a step back, brushing him off like a bad memory. &#34;How I do it isn&#39;t your concern. You&#39;re only desperate to land this project because your company&#39;s falling apart. Once it&#39;s settled, I want Cooper Group back. Then we&#39;re done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A muscle in Liam&#39;s jaw twitched. &#34;Kayla, can&#39;t we stop talking about divorce? Isn&#39;t there still something left between us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, but I can&#39;t stand being with you anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s patience snapped. He didn&#39;t want to keep arguing in front of the hospital. &#34;Let&#39;s go home,&#34; he said,irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive was painfully silent. The tension sat thick between them, neither willing to break it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent of his secretary&#39;s perfume drifted through the car,and Kayla&#39;s stomach turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled the window down,letting in the breeze.The nausea eased. Liam handed her a bottle of water. &#34;I heard about your grandmother being rushed to the ER. I couldn&#39;t visit today, but I&#39;ll go with you tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need,&#34; she replied without looking at him.&#34;I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she didn&#39;t take the water, he quietly returned it to the holder He assumed she was just upset about her grandmother and chose not to press her further</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try not to argue with Zoe and Amaya again I heard they&#39;re refusing to help pay for your grandmother&#39;s treatment. Don&#39;t worry-I&#39;ll make sure she gets the care she needs&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered when he promised she&#39;d never be hurt again as long as he was around</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it hadn&#39;t taken long, less than a month into the marriage, for him to betray her in the worst way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All those vows were just lies wrapped in affection</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d found out about his affair with his secretary not long after they got married. It was then she learned-men&#39;s promises couldn&#39;t be trusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drained, she leaned against the seat and shut her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they pulled into the villa driveway, Liam stepped  out of the car, thinking she had dozed off</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to lift her into his arms when his phone rang Pausing, he turned slightly away and answered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Graham, I&#39;m not feeling well. I&#39;m alone at the hospital Could you come and stay with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice was gentle but just loud enough for Kayla to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her eyes, a smirk curlinng at the edge of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam glanced at Kayla before answering in a low voice,&#34;I&#39;m busy. There are doctors at the hospital. If you&#39;re not feeling well, see one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;m really scared_&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam ended the call before she could finish. When he turned back, Kayla was already heading toward the villa on her own, not sparing him a glance</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the housekeeper had laid out a light meal The food helped settle the discomfort she&#39;d felt earlier</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs Graham, your appetite&#39;s been great lately,&#34; the housekeeper said with a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liamn looked over at her, his expression softening just a little. &#34;If you&#39;re feeling better, then eat more You&#39;ve  You need to look after yourself&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m full. I&#39;ll be upstairs&#34; Without waiting for a response, Kayla stood and made her way to the staircase</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s eyes settled on her empty plate. He couldn&#39;t ignore the change-she was eating more lately It was subtle, but noticeable. He used to urge her to eat, but she never paid him any mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was probably exhausted from looking after her grandmother all day and hadn&#39;t had a proper meal earlier</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the housekeeper, he said, &#34;From now on,prepare her meals on time. And remind her to eat, no matter how busy she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper gave a cheerful nod. &#34;Understood,Mr.Graham.You really care about her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Liam&#39;s mind, no one else could possibly care for Kayla the way he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just upset-she&#39;d cool down eventually. And when she did, she&#39;d come back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But later that night, around eleven, Liam left the house again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another late outing. Most likely to see his secretary Kayla didn&#39;t react. She didn&#39;t feel angry, or even disappointed anymore Instead, she asked the company staff to send over the project files and spent some time reviewing the details of the collaboration with North Investment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was going to find a way to get Jeremy&#39;s approval</p>
                
                
                
                <p>North Investment was the largest multinational investment group in Trark. For a mid-level company Like Perennia Group, securing a partnership with them was nearly unthinkable</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Liam had one advantage-he was Jeremy&#39;s nephew That alone gave him a lead over everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla wasn&#39;t backing down. She went through every detail. After a long night, she finally devised a plan</p>
