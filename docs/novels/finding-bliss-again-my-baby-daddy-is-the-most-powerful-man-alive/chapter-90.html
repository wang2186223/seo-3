                <p>Jeremy&#39;s lips curled into a faint smile. &#34;What&#39;s going on? Why are you suddenly coming to me for money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam glanced up, his expression respectful but cautious. &#34;You&#39;re now a shareholder in Perennia Group.I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve reviewed its internal affairs. I&#39;m strapped for funds and was hoping you could help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy studied him. &#34;How much are we talking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam raised a single finger and furrowed his brows.&#34;Ten million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy absentmindedly ran his fingers along the rim of his cup, the corners of his mouth twitching. &#34;And what makes you think I&#39;d give that to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest, it&#39;s to clear some debts and to buy Cooper Group back. If I pull that off, Kayla won&#39;t divorce me.&#34; Liam hesitated, then added, &#34;Ten million&#39;s impossible for me. But for you, it&#39;s pocket change. I&#39;ve never asked you for anything before. Just this once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cup in Jeremy&#39;s hand slipped, shattering on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam blinked but quickly moved to clean it, picking up the shards with a tissue and tossing them in the trash with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could straighten, Jeremy grabbed him by the collar and yanked him up, eyes sharp and ice cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this your mother&#39;s idea?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Liam said quickly, shaking his head. &#34;This is between you and me. My mother doesn&#39;t meddle in Perennia Group&#39;s affairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp shove, Jeremy released him. Liam stumbled back, landing hard on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy adjusted his cuffs, looking down with disdain.&#34;If your mother weren&#39;t Janiya, I might have considered it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he stepped over Liam and strode out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam stayed on the floor, hands clenched, face darkening with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the door, Zoe, who had been shamelessly eavesdropping, jumped when it swung open. She clutched her chest, feigning innocence. &#34;Jeremy!You&#39;re done already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy gave her a dismissive nod and kept walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe peeked into the room, catching sight of Liam on the floor, looking thoroughly wrecked. She sneered and muttered, &#34;You totally had that coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,seeing Jeremy getting farther away,she clicked her heels after him. &#34;Jeremy, wait for me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were gone, Liam&#39;s assistant hurried in and reached out to help him up. &#34;Sir, are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam angrily slapped the hand away. &#34;I don&#39;t need help.I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant hesitated, then spoke carefully. &#34;Maybe we should give up on raising the funds. If even your uncle won&#39;t help, there might not be another way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; Liam snapped. His voice trembled with fury.&#34;I&#39;ll remember this. One day, when I surpass him,I&#39;ll make him pay back this humiliation tenfold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant mumbled under his breath,doubting Liam could ever reach that level, but wisely kept the thought to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Liam&#39;s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen and let out a groan. It was the caregiver. He picked up. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Graham, the massage bed for Marsha has arrived.Would you like to come inspect it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s there to see? It&#39;s just a bed. Handle it yourselves,&#34; Liam replied, irritation mounting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause. &#34;Sir, you specifically asked us to notify you when it arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. &#34;Fine.I&#39;ll come now.&#34; ...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla finished her work and took Marsha for a stroll in the park. When they returned, she stopped in the doorway, spotting a new massage bed set up in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows drew together. &#34;What&#39;s this? Please have it moved next door. It&#39;s not suitable for her condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caregiver stepped forward. &#34;Mr. Graham arranged for it. He said it would help with your grandmother&#39;s recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla bit her tongue. Liam, who barely acknowledged Marsha&#39;s health, was now an expert in physical therapy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed. With the help of two security guards, the bed was relocated into an empty room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At 3 PM, Kayla got a call from Archie reminding her of a project meeting at North Investment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After settling Marsha, she rushed over, only to be informed the meeting had been delayed by an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already outside the conference room, Kayla sat down to review her materials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Jeremy&#39;s secretary, Edna Hilton, approached.&#34;Kayla,here for the North Investment meeting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla nodded. Noticing the boxes of cold medicine in Edna&#39;s hands, she asked, &#34;Are you feeling sick?&#34; Edna shook her head. &#34;It&#39;s for MAr. Graham. He&#39;s got a fever but refuses to rest. Edwin asked me to bring this up to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla blinked. Even with a fever, Jeremy was working?No wonder North Investment was unstoppable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Edna&#39;s phone rang. She answered, her tone brisk. &#34;Yes. Understood. I&#39;ll head there now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, she turned to Kayla. &#34;Would you mind taking this up for me? The records department just dumped a new pile of files on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Kayla could object, Edna pressed the medicine into her hands and hurried off down the hall.</p>
