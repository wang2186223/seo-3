                <p>Zoe stomped forward, her face twisted with rage &#34;Kayla,what were you doing in Jeremy&#39;s house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla held her gaze, unfazed. &#34;And why exactly can&#39;t I be here? This place doesn&#39;t belong to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe let out a mocking snort &#34;You&#39;re Liam&#39;s wife Hovering around his uncle? Completely out of line.You should really keep your distance&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gave a quiet laugh &#34;Wow. Giving orders like that? Maybe try actually becoming Jeremy&#39;s wife before acting the part Right now, it&#39;s a bit too early for that&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s face flushed, her embarrassment quickly morphing into smugness &#34;Let me guess You offended Jeremy, and your husband sent you to clean up the mess? Makes sense He&#39;s not exactly loved by the Graham family If Jeremy&#39;s patience runs out, you both could be cut off for good&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe went on, her tone sharp with contempt &#34;You and that worthless husband of yours really do suit each other&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time when Kayla would have exploded at anyone insulting Liam and wouldn&#39;t have held back with Zoe But now? She didn&#39;t care Zoe could talk all she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dramatic toss of her hair, Zoe turned to walk away,her heels clicking with every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, mocking smile played on Kayla&#39;s lips. Just as Zoe walked by, Kayla casually slipped her foot out in her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe toppled forward and landed flat on her face with a loud,graceless thud</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments ago, she looked every bit the polished socialite. Now, she was sprawled on the floor,humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla covered her mouth to hold back a laugh. &#34;Oops.Careful-wouldn&#39;t want something artificial falling out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe clutched her chest, her face red with fury as she looked up. &#34;You&#39;re unbelievable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla tilted her head slightly &#34;Yesterday, when you tripped me, that was pretty unbelievable too. Think of this as a payback.&#34; Fuming, Zoe hurried to her feet, her hair tangled and wild, and charged at Kayla, shaking with fury</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stepped aside effortlessly, and Zoe lost her balance again, nearly going down a second time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next time you feel like starting something, Zoe,make sure you&#39;re up for it. Know your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, Kayla turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe stood frozen,her chest rising and falling sharply,her face flushed with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler had seen everything. He turned around and went back into the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy sat quietly in the living room,lost in thought since Kayla had walked out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin finally spoke up, unable to stay quiet. &#34;Mr Graham, if you&#39;re aiming for Perennia Group, why not just buy the whole thing? Why bother with share negotiations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy gave a light shrug, his voice casual.′′An outright takeover would be too dull. And the way Kayla linked me to Liam&#39;s mother? It shows she&#39;s  serious about locking down this project, regardless of Liam&#39;s opinion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin looked uncertain. &#34;But they&#39;re married. Isn&#39;t her behavior a little off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If their marriage is already crumbling,then what she&#39;s doing adds up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin&#39;s brows furrowed into a frown.&#34;But the wedding was just recent. How did things go downhill so fast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy glanced up, his voice suddenly cold. &#34;What&#39;s the latest on Kayla&#39;s background?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin got straight to the point. &#34;Kayla moved out of her father&#39;s place a long time ago. After her mother died,her father,Damon Cooper,married his mistress.Since then, Kayla hasn&#39;t gotten along with them.That&#39;s what led to the argument yesterday. Also, I found out that she and Liam are in the middle of a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy lifted his cup and took a slow sip, saying nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin continued, &#34;It seems Kayla found out that Liam&#39;s a little too close to his secretary. That&#39;s what pushed her to file for divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy placed his cup down and said casually,&#34;Forget about Kayla for now. What did you find out  about the other thing I asked you to look into?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zoe was indeed at the hotel that night. The brooch you found? It&#39;s hers. The Cooper family staff said Damon gifted her two identical ones years ago. That confirms it-she&#39;s the woman who was in your room that night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy nodded slowly.&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had been with him that night, then he&#39;d have to take responsibility for what happened</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Graham.&#34; The butler stepped in. &#34;Kayla and Zoe ran into each other outside. Things got a little tense,and Kayla ended up tripping Zoe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeremy let out a dry laugh. &#34;She&#39;s got some fire in her.&#34;</p>
