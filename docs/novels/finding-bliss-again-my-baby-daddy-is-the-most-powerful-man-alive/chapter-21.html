                <p>Inside the care facility, Marsha ate in her room. Across from her, the caregiver was keeping her company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla stood at the doorway, her eyes fixed on her grandmother. Waves of grief washed over her, heavy and unrelenting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Jeremy hadn&#39;t stepped in tonight, she didn&#39;t know what would have happened to her grandmother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Marsha drifted in and out, her thoughts wandering off like loose balloons, sometimes disappearing completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla!&#34; A burst of footsteps echoed down the hall, and Liam burst through the doorway, his chest heaving and worry etched deep into his face. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry. Something urgent pulled me away. I never imagined Marsha would leave the park while I was gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Kayla&#39;s palm cracked across his cheek. The sting was immediate and sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the heat spread across his face, Liam flinched, stunned by the force of her anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her hand still trembling, Kayla glared at him. &#34;Liam, this is it. I can&#39;t do this anymore. It&#39;s over between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Redness bloomed on his cheek as Liam faced her, desperation clinging to his words. &#34;Kayla, please. I knowl let you down, but I promise I won&#39;t take my eyes off Marsha again. Just give me one more chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s voice was ice-cold. &#34;Admit it. You left my grandmother alone because you wanted to be with Tricia. If you want her so badly, just end our marriage and get it over with. Nothing&#39;s stopping you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frantic shake of his head accompanied&#39;Liam&#39;s plea. &#34;No, you&#39;ve got it wrong. There&#39;s nothing between me and Tricia. I only care about you. You&#39;re my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Kayla stormed across the room, grabbed a stack of papers, and hurled them at him. &#34;Jeremy signed the contract. You made a promise-once I landed this contract, we&#39;d end it.&#34; Paralyzed,Liam stood motionless, the reality sinking in like a cold wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared down at the contract lying on the floor, watching his marriage unravel in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hard finality colored Kayla&#39;s tone. &#34;Tomorrow at nine, the courthouse. That&#39;s when we finish this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock drained the color from Liam&#39;s cheeks as his hands tightened into fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No part of him had truly believed that Kayla would manage to win Jeremy&#39;s approval for the project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Releasing his grip, Liam stooped to retrieve the contract. A bitter smile crossed his face. &#34;Alright, tomorrow it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about Liam&#39;s reaction made Kayla pause, though she was relieved that he hadn&#39;t put up a fight about the divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking back, she walked away, retreating into the room and shutting the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage took over, and Liam&#39;s knuckles whitened around the contract. One harsh swing sent the papers flying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the hallway, Tricia stepped in and picked up the scattered contract with careful hands. &#34;Why wreck this? This is our lifeline. The company needs this partnership, whether you like it or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glare colder than steel shot from Liam&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia offered an innocent shrug. &#34;Why are you looking at me like that? Kayla&#39;s made up her mind. You can&#39;t stop her from walking away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Divorce isn&#39;t happening!&#34; Liam shouted, shoving past her, fury pulsing in every stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dark scowl clouded Tricia&#39;s face as she hurried after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, Kayla returned home, intent on packing her things and moving on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Near the closet, the maid lingered, watching as Kayla folded her clothes, worry etched across her brow.&#34;Ma&#39;am, where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m divorcing Liam. I won&#39;t be calling this place home anymore,&#34; said Kayla, her tone resolute. Uncertainty flickered in the maid&#39;s eyes as Kayla shoved her belongings into a suitcase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam rushed back after the maid&#39;s call. He found Kayla halfway down the stairs, suitcase in hand. &#34;Kayla,just stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla squared her shoulders and met his gaze. &#34;I&#39;m leaving now, Liam. We&#39;re finished. Don&#39;t come after me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Redness rimmed Liam&#39;s eyes as he seized her shoulders. &#34;You&#39;re ending everything we&#39;ve built with just a few words? Kayla, is your heart really that cold?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of revulsion crossed Kayla&#39;s face as she shoved his hands aside. &#34;If anyone&#39;s heartless, it&#39;s you. Get out of my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blocking her path, Liam clamped down on the suitcase. &#34;You&#39;re not going anywhere,Kayla.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of me,&#34; she snapped, tugging at the handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s voice rose with frustration. &#34;I said, you&#39;re staying right here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their tug-of-war sent one of Kayla&#39;s belongings-a ring-clattering to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faster than Kayla could reách it, Liam scooped up the ring and turned it over in his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion darkened Liam&#39;s face as his gaze darted from the ring to Kayla.&#34;Where did you get Uncle Jeremy&#39;s ring? What are you hiding from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hand it over!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla lunged for the ring. Instead of backing down, Liam grabbed the collar of her shirt, holding her in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter accusation tumbled from his lips. &#34;Did you really cozy up to Jeremy just to seal this deal? That ring isn&#39;t just a trinket-it&#39;s a symbol of who he is. You expect me to believe he just handed it to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury built inside him, blazing through his chest and flickering in his glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving up the struggle, Kayla fixed him with a cold stare. &#34;What difference does it make how I secured the contract? You wanted a divorce. You wanted Perennia Group to have a future. Well, Jeremy handed it to you. Don&#39;t mess this up. If you do, you&#39;ll always be a nobody.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushed too far, Liam released her with a shout. &#34;I don&#39;t need his help to make Perennia Group succeed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why did you ask for his help in the first place? Quit lying to yourself, Liam. It&#39;s time you admit the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snatching the ring from his grasp, Kayla gripped her suitcase and walked away without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furniture rattled and gass shattered behind her as Liam&#39;s rage tore through the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not once did Kayla glance back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaken by the chaos, Tricia appeared in the doorway.&#34;Stop tearing the place apart. The ring might not even be Jeremy&#39;s. Maybe it&#39;s from someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding his teeth, Liam glared at the door where Kayla had vanished. &#34;I&#39;m not letting her leave me, no matter what.&#34;</p>
