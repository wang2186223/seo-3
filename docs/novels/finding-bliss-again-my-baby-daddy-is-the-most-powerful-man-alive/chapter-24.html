                <p>Kayla&#39;s fists clenched at her sides. The urge to scream-or spit in Liam&#39;s smug face-threatened to overwhelm her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone be so shameless? After everything they&#39;d been through, only now was Liam&#39;s true nature fully revealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her grandmother still believed in him. As if he&#39;d put her under some spell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Martha stepped forward, her grip tightening around Kayla&#39;s hand. &#34;No matter what happened, you two can still work it out. There&#39;s no need to end things like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s voice was steady but firm. &#34;I&#39;ve made up my mind, Grandma. This marriage is over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to drive me to my grave!&#34; Martha suddenly gasped, her chest heaving as she clutched at it in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma!&#34; Kayla&#39;s eyes widened in alarm as she rushed to support her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Martha&#39;s face had gone pale, her breath shallow and uneven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam, standing nearby, jumped in with false concern. &#34;Let&#39;s get her back to the care facility. She can&#39;t handle this kind of stress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla shot him a look so cold it could cut steel. If looks could kill, Liam would have dropped on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the facility, Martha remained confused and restless. She clung to Kayla&#39;s hand, repeating the same plea over and over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mother&#39;s marriage fell apart, and it destroyed her. I just don&#39;t want the same for you. Liam made mistakes, sure, but people change. You two just need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla looked into her grandmother&#39;s kind, tired eyes and could no longer hold back the truth. &#34;He cheated on me, Grandma. Just like my father did my mother.&#34; Martha froze. Disbelief flooded her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla gently brushed her grandmother&#39;s silver hair from her forehead. &#34;I know you only want the best for me. But Liam and I are finished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Martha&#39;s voice cracked. &#34;You must be mistaken,sweetheart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too weary to argue, Kayla exhaled deeply. &#34;Please, just rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only once Martha drifted off to sleep did Kayla finally leave the facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam was waiting outside, leaning against his car. When he saw her, he straightened. &#34;Is Marsha okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answer came in the form of a resounding slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s head turned with the impact, pain flashing across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayla&#39;s face was burning with rage. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare try to hide behind my grandmother to stop this divorce.Have some shame, Liam. You make me sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam ran his tongue along the inside of his cheek, tasting blood. He wiped it away and gave her a slow,almost affectionate smile. &#34;I didn&#39;t know you had this side to you, Kayla. Fiery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice took on that infuriatingly familiar tone-the same one he&#39;d used back when she&#39;d broken a vase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She used to think that made him gentle; that she was lucky to have a man like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, it made her skin crawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liam, I&#39;m not done with you. Not even close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned her back on him and flagged down a cab.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam watched her go, his cheek still stinging, but his smile remained. She hadn&#39;t divorced him yet. That was all he needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone buzzed. It was his assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Graham, you need to get to the office. North Investment just sent a team to audit us.&#34; &#34;What? We&#39;re just partners! They don&#39;t have the right to do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, I think you&#39;d better come and see for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam stormed into his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,Edwin stood with a team, already laying out files. He tossed a thick document onto the desk as Liam entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liam, your uncle is now a major stakeholder in Perennia Group. This is a standard audit. Please cooperate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam stared at the document in confusion. When he saw the signature at the bottom, his face twisted in disbelief. &#34;Kayla transferred hér shares to Jeremy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin raised a brow. &#34;You think you can toss Mr. Graham&#39;s name around like it&#39;s yours to use?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s voice turned desperate. &#34;No offense meant. I had no clue Kayla signed this. There must be some mistake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin tapped the document with a finger. &#34;There&#39;s no mistake. Your wife signed over her shares. See for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s face darkened as he gripped the paper. Even furious, he knew better than to lash out in front of Edwin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin stepped closer, smirking slightly. &#34;You were eager enough to cozy up to North Investment. Now that Mr. Graham&#39;s personally involved, you should be thrilled. And your wife said you&#39;ll be returning Cooper Group. If not, Mr. Graham&#39;s happy to handle it for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s eyes narrowed, fury simmering beneath the surface. &#34;There&#39;s no need to bother UJncle Jeremy.I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Let&#39;s begin the audit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Edwin and his team moved out into the office, instructing all staff to stand by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tricia crept over, voice barely above a whisper. &#34;Liam, what do we do? If they find out about the cooked numbers-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam cut her off with a glare that could kill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went silent instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let them dig,&#34; he muttered.&#34;Ifanything surfaces, we&#39;ll blame it on past partners. Jeremy can&#39;t touch me.I&#39;m the one running Perennia Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He strode from his office, watching Edwin like a hawk as the audit began.</p>
