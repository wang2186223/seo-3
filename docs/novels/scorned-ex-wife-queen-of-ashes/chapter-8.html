                <p>CAMILLE&#39;S POINT OF VIEW</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nightmare grabbed me by the throat, dragging me under before| could fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was standing in the rain outside a restaurant, my face pressed against cold glass, watching Rose and Stefan inside. They sat at a candlelit table,champagne glasses raised in a toast. Stefan wore the tie l&#39;d given him last Christmas. Rose wore my engagement ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their laughter reached me somehow, cutting through the glass barrier. They were laughing at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see her face?&#34; Rose&#39;s voice echoed unnaturally loud. &#34;When she found the divorce papers? Like a stupid puppy being abandoned at the shelter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan chuckled, pouring more champagne.&#34;And when she realized it was you? God, I almost felt sorry for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Almost,&#34; Rose agreed, her smile shark-like. &#34;But not quite. She made it too easy, Stef. Always so desperate to be loved. So willing to believe the lies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They clinked glasses again. The sound transformed into breaking glass, shattering windows, car metal crumpling...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scene shifted. I was in my car, rain hammering the windshield, wipers fighting a losing battle against the downpour. My cheeks were wet-tears or rain,I couldn&#39;t tell anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Headlights appeared behind me, too bright,too fast.Gaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped the steering wheel tighter, foot pressing the accelerator. The headlights grew closer, lighting up my rearview mirror until I was blind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bump.Metal against metal. My car swerved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I was flying, the world spinning as my car broke through the bridge railing. That weightless moment of suspension before gravity remembered me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water rushed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I screamed, the sound ending in a gurgle as icy water filled my lungs. As I sank, I saw them standing on the bridge. Rose. Stefan. My parents. All watching impassively as I drowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rose waved goodbye, her smile triumphant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should we call someone?&#34; my mother asked, not particularly concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why bother?&#34; my father replied. &#34;She was always such a disappointment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water closed over my head, and darkness pulled me down, down, down...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke gasping, sheets tangled around my legs like grasping hands. For terrifying seconds, I couldn&#39;t remember where I was. The ceiling above me was unfamiliar, painted cherubs, golden trim, luxury | hadn&#39;t earned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria. The adoption.My new life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reality settled back, but the terror remained,clinging to my skin like river mud. I pushed myself upright,ignoring the protest from my healing ribs. Sweat plastered my nightgown to my body, and my heart hammered against my chest like it was trying to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The digital clock on the bedside table glowed 3:17AM. Too early to be awake, too late to hope for peaceful sleep. I swung my legs over the side of the bed, needing to move, to prove to myself I wasn&#39;t drowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marble floor was cold against my bare feet as l padded to the bathroom, flipping on lights as I wNent.The woman in the mirror was a stranger - hollow eyes, skin pale as paper, hair wild from thrashing in my sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I splashed cold water on my face, trying to wash away the nightmare&#39;s residue. But when I closed my eyes, I saw them again. Laughing. Toasting.Celebrating my destruction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sound escaped me, something between a laugh and a sob. The absurdity suddenly hit me-I was standing in a bathroom worth more than my old car,in a mansion owned by one of the world&#39;s wealthiest women, who wanted to adopt me because I looked like her dead daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The laugh bubbled up again, louder this time, edged with hysteria. I pressed my hand against my mouth,trying to hold it in, but it was too late. The dam had broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slid down the bathroom wall until I hit the floor,laughter transforming to sobs that tore through my chest. Every breath hurt my bruised ribs, but l couldn&#39;t stop. Years of swallowed tears demanded release.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried for the little girl who&#39;d never been enough. For the college dreams crushed by Rose&#39;s lies. For three years of marriage to a man who&#39;d never truly seen me. For the weak, trusting fool l&#39;d been, giving chances to people who only wanted to use them against me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands curled into fists, nails digging half-moons into my palms. The physical pain was almost a relief,something solid to focus on instead of the gaping emptiness inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice cut through my breakdown like a knife.Victoria stood in the doorway, silver hair loose around her shoulders, wrapped in a black silk robe.Her face gave nothing away, but her eyes were sharp,assessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shame burned through me. She&#39;d offered me strength, power, a chance at revenge, and here I was,dissolving on her bathroom floor at three in the morning. Proving everyone right about weak,emotional Camille.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to stand, to salvage some dignity, but my legs wouldn&#39;t cooperate. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I managed,voice raw from crying. &#34;The nightmare...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me.&#34; Not a request.A command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, then described the dream in halting sentences. The restaurant. The bridge. The water.Their faces as they watched me drown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria listened without interruption, without pitying murmurs or comforting platitudes. When I finished,she simply nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at her. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get up,&#34; she repeated, extending one hand. &#34;This floor is no place for a Kane.&#34;②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit like a splash of cold water. This floor was no place for a Kane. And that&#39;s who I was now,or who I was becoming. Not weak Camille Lewis, but Camille Kane.Heir. Survivor. Avenger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took her hand, letting her pull me to my feet. Her grip was surprisingly strong for a woman her age,fingers cool and dry against my tear-damp skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Follow me,&#34; she said, turning without checking if l would obey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed her through darkened hallways, past priceless artwork and antiques that glowed dimly in the shadows. We descended a grand staircase, my bare feet silent on plush carpet, and entered a part of the mansion I hadn&#39;t seen before.</p>
