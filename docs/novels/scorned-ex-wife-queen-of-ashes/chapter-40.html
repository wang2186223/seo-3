                <p>Stefan stared at the empty boardroom seats, his hands shaking as he reached for another glass of water. The morning&#39;s board meeting felt like a firing squad,twelve angry faces demanding explanations he didn&#39;t have. Someone was systematically destroying Rodriguez Shipping, but he couldn&#39;t figure out who or why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The numbers are disastrous,&#34; Andrew Parker, head of the finance committee, said coldly. &#34;Sixty-two percent stock drop. Major contracts vanishing.Suppliers backing out. And you still can&#39;t tell us what&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve had every analyst working around the clock,&#34;Stefan replied, hating the weakness in his voice. &#34;The attacks are coming from multiple directions. Every time we plug one hole, three more appear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Attacks?&#34; Parker&#39;s laugh held no warmth. &#34;Or just incompetence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other board members muttered in agreement. Three hours of defending himself, showing reports,promising solutions - none of it mattered. They wanted his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A vote has been called,&#34; Thomas Chen announced,his voice heavy with false regret. &#34;On the immediate removal of Stefan Rodriguez as Chief Executive Officer of Rodriguez Shipping International.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan&#39;s stomach turned to ice. This wasn&#39;t happening.The company had survived world wars, economic crashes, countless crises. Now it was crumbling and he couldn&#39;t even identify the enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All in favor...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boardroom doors flew open. Eduardo Rodriguez filled the doorway, commanding attention without speaking a word. Stefan had never been so grateful to see his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This meeting is suspended,&#34; Eduardo announced,moving to the head of the table. &#34;By authority of the family&#39;s controlling shares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Parker stood, face flushed. &#34;Mr. Rodriguez, with respect, the board has authority to...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The board has what authority I permit it to have.&#34;Eduardo&#39;s voice could have frozen fire.&#34;Right now, I&#39;m permitting you all to leave while I speak with my son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That wasn&#39;t a suggestion.&#34; Eduardo&#39;s eyes swept the room. &#34;Out. All of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They filed out slowly, Parker throwing Stefan a look that promised this wasn&#39;t finished. When the door closed, silence fell heavy between father and son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a disappointment.&#34; Eduardo&#39;s words cut deep.&#34;But you&#39;re still my son. Still a Rodriguez.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan stared at his hands. &#34;Someone&#39;s targeting us.Every move we make, they&#39;re three steps ahead. It&#39;s like they know our playbook better than we do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you&#39;re too busy planning a wedding to see what&#39;s right in front of you.&#34; His father moved to the window. &#34;Too focused on that Lewis girl to protect what generations built.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rose has nothing to do with-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rose has everything to do with it.&#34; Eduardo turned,eyes hard. &#34;Ever since you divorced Camille...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t.&#34; Stefan&#39;s voice cracked. &#34;Please don&#39;t bring her into this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not? She understood business. Understood loyalty. Then she has some convenient accident and suddenly you&#39;re engaged to her sister?&#34; His father&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;Even I can see something wrong there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan&#39;s chest tightened. If his father knew the truth about Camille...about what really happened that night..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The board wants you gone,&#34; Eduardo continued.&#34;They&#39;re not wrong. You&#39;ve let someone gut this company piece by piece.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; The words tasted like ash. &#34;I&#39;ll resign. Save everyone the trouble of voting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan looked up, confused. &#34;No?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re my son.&#34; Eduardo&#39;s voice softened slightly.&#34;Despite everything, you&#39;re my blood. I&#39;ve convinced the board to give you one month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope flickered faintly. &#34;One month?&#34;2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To find who&#39;s behind this. To save what&#39;s left. To prove you deserve the Rodriguez name.&#34; His father&#39;s expression hardened again. &#34;But there are conditions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course there were. There always were with Eduardo Rodriguez.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What conditions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First,postpone this wedding circus. No distractions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan nodded slowly. Rose wouldn&#39;t like it, but she&#39;d have to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Second,you move back to the family estate. I want you focused, where I can watch you work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another nod. Easier than the first condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Third,&#34; Eduardo paused, &#34;you tell me the truth about Camille&#39;s accident. Everything you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan&#39;s blood turned to ice. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a fool, son. The timing was too convenient.The body never found. And now you&#39;re marrying her sister?&#34; Eduardo&#39;s eyes bore into him. &#34;What really happened to your wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question that haunted his nightmares. The truth he&#39;d buried under grief and guilt and Rose&#39;s careful manipulations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I don&#39;t know everything,&#34; he said carefully.&#34;There were things... suggestions... but nothing certain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you have one month to find certainty.&#34; Eduardo moved to the door. &#34;The board returns in five minutes.They&#39;ll announce the probation period. Thirty days to save this company and find who&#39;s trying to destroy us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, hand on the doorknob. &#34;And Stefan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something tells me these attacks and Camille&#39;s disappearance might be connected. Think about who would want both you and this company destroyed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The board members filed back in, taking their seats with obvious reluctance. Parker especially looked ready to object, but Eduardo&#39;s presence kept him silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gentlemen,&#34; Eduardo addressed them. &#34;My son has thirty days to reverse our losses. If he fails, I&#39;ll personally request his removal. If he succeeds, we all benefit. Did you all agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, they nodded. Not happy, but unwilling to fight Eduardo Rodriguez when he used that tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thirty days,&#34; Parker said, glaring at Stefan. &#34;Not one day more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan barely heard the rest of the meeting. His mind kept spinning with questions. Who had the resources and motivation to attack them so precisely? Why did every defensive move fail before it started? How did the enemy always know exactly where to strike?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And underneath it all, his father&#39;s words about Camille kept echoing. About finding the truth. About connections he hadn&#39;t let himself consider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone buzzed, Rose asking about wedding venue deposits. He ignored it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty days to save his family&#39;s legacy. To uncover the truth about his wife&#39;s disappearance. To face whatever Rose had been hiding all this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow,he didn&#39;t think he could do both.</p>
