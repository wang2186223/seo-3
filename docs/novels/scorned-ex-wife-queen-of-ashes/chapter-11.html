                <p>CAMILLE&#39;S POINT OF VIEW</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stanford University, class of 2016. Summa cum laude. Double major in Economics and Computer Science.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the diploma in my hands, the heavy paper embossed with gold seals and signatures. My name,Camille Kane written in elegant calligraphy across the center. A degree I never earned from a university I&#39;d never attended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is this possible?&#34; | asked, running my finger over the raised seal. It felt real. Everything felt real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria sat across from me in her private office,walls lined with dark wood and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. A massive desk separated us, covered with documents spread out like puzzle pieces forming my new life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Money opens many doors,&#34; she said, sliding another folder toward me. &#34;People are surprisingly willing to alter records when the price is right. The right donation to the alumni fund, the right conversation with the right dean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the folder to find transcripts, teacher evaluations, even photos of &#34;me&#34; at graduation. The woman in the pictures looked like me, but with subtle differences, straightened hair, confident posture,designer clothes I&#39;d never owned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not me,&#34; I whispered, touching the smiling graduate&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Digital manipulation. Quite good, isn&#39;t it? We had an expert blend your features with photos of a real Stanford graduate. Just enough to pass as you if no one looks too closely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved to the next document. Harvard Business School acceptance letter, followed by more transcripts, more doctored photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MBA with focus on venture capital and emerging markets,&#34; Victoria continued, watching me closely.&#34;You were quiet but brilliant. Professors remember you as intensely private but insightful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And these professors will confirm this if asked?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s smile was thin. &#34;They already have. Three different background checks from various business publications have contacted them. All received the same carefully constructed memories of the remarkable but reserved Camille Kane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head spun. The depth of the deception was staggering. An entire life constructed from nothing,solid enough to withstand scrutiny.③</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about before college? High school?Childhood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria handed me another folder, thicker than the others. &#34;Your entire history. Private schooling in Switzerland. Before that, exclusive boarding schools to shield you from media attention after | adopted you at age ten. Your biological parents, distant relations of mine died in a yacht accident off the coast of Monaco.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The folder contained school records, newspaper clippings of the accident, adoption papers dated fifteen years ago. Photos of a young girl who resembled me but wasn&#39;t quite right another digital creation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The backstory explains your absence from public life,&#34; Victoria said. &#34;You were my closely guarded secret, educated abroad to protect you from those who might exploit our connection. It also explains why you&#39;re only now stepping into the spotlight as my heir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed the folder, suddenly needing air. The weight of this new identity pressed down, both gift and burden. Freedom and cage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s more,&#34; Victoria said, gesturing to the remaining files. &#34;Medical records. Tax filings.Property deeds for apartments in New York and Paris you&#39;ve supposedly owned for years. Even a driving record with a speeding ticket from 2018.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The speeding ticket?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Authenticity requires imperfection. A life too clean raises questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood, moving to the window overlooking Manhattan. Sixty floors below, people scurried like ants, unaware of the fiction being written in this room. A fiction that would soon become my reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Social media?&#34; | asked, knowing the answer already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carefully curated accounts dating back eight years.Limited posts, tasteful photos from global locations,the exact digital footprint one would expect from a private heiress. Our team has been building them slowly, posting backdated content on secure servers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned back to her. &#34;And what about the real me?Camille Lewis? What happens to her records, her accounts, her life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s face softened, just slightly. &#34;Already managed. Your college records show an unremarkable student who never graduated. Your employment history reflects a series of administrative jobs with long gaps between. Your medical files now include notes about depression and instability.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter taste filled my mouth. &#34;Making my suicide more believable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Precisely.&#34; Victoria was unapologetic. &#34;The more your disappearance aligns with expectations, the less anyone will question it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed a button on her desk phone. &#34;Send in James with the final packet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, a tall man in a dark suit entered carrying a sleek laptop and several files. He nodded respectfully before sefting them on the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The surveillance report, Ms. Kane,&#34; he said to Victoria. &#34;And the social media monitoring as requested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, James. That will be all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He departed silently, closing the heavy door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria opened one of the files, considering its contents before looking up at me. &#34;Are you ready for this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready for what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To see what your sister and ex-husband have been doing since your... departure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach tightened. Part of me wanted to say no,to preserve the numbness I&#39;d carefully cultivated since burying my old life at the cemetery. But the stronger part, the part Victoria was nurturing,needed to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Show me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She handed me the file. Inside were surveillance photos, dozens of them, crisp and professional.Rose and Stefan walking hand-in-hand through an airport.Rose and Stefan dining at a rooftop restaurant. Rose wearing a white sundress on a beach, Stefan kissing her beneath an umbrella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Their romantic getaway,&#34; Victoria explained unnecessarily. &#34;Santorini. They left three days after your memorial service.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the images, waiting for pain that didn&#39;t come. Instead, a cold clarity washed over me. They looked happy. Carefree. Unburdened by the woman they&#39;d discarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They didn&#39;t even wait a month,&#34; I said, my voice strange to mny own ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grief has its own timeline,&#34; Victoria replied, her tone making it clear what she thought of their mourning period.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More photos showed them shopping, swimming,posing for selfies with the blue Mediterranean behind them. In each one, Rose looked triumphant. The victor who&#39;d finally claimed her prize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s more,&#34; Victoria said, opening the laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Social media monitoring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen showed Rose&#39;s Instagram account, newly updated with she and Stefan photos. The caption beneath a sunset picture read: &#34;Finding joy again after unimaginable loss. Camille would have wanted us to be happy. #NewBeginnings #LoveWins&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh escapoed me, harsh and unfamiliar. &#34;She&#39;s using my &#39;death&#39; for likes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your father commented,&#34; Victoria noted, scrolling down. &#34;&#39;So happy you&#39;ve found comfort in each other. Camille is watching over you both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room seemed to tilt sideways. My parents. The ones who should have questioned everything. Who should have demanded justice, investigation,answers. Instead, they were blessing this union built on betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep scrolling,&#34; I said, needing to see it all, to burn it into my memory:</p>
