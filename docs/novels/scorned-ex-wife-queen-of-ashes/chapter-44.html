                <p>Camille&#39;s point of view</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Metropolitan Museum sparkled like a jewel box,transformed for the annual Children&#39;s Hospital Benefit.Diamonds caught light from a thousand candles,champagne flowed in crystal flutes, and the wealthy elite of New York performed their yearly ritual of competitive generosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved through the crowd in a midnight blue gown,Victoria&#39;s careful training evident in every step. My hair swept up in an elegant twist, my makeup flawless,my smile measured and controlled. Camille Kane,heiress to a fortune, daughter of power. A woman these people now courted rather than dismissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How different from the last charity gala I&#39;d attended as Camille Lewis. Then, I&#39;d stood in Rose&#39;s shadow,wearing a dress she&#39;d &#34;allowed&#34; me to borrow,watching society ladies air-kiss her cheeks while barely glancing my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Kane.&#34; The hospital director approached,practically glowing with anticipation. &#34;Your mother&#39;s donation will fund our new pediatric wing. We&#39;re beyond grateful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, accepting her gratitude with the perfect blend of humility and confidence Victoria had taught me.&#34;Kane Industries believes in investing in the future.These children deserve our best efforts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely! Would you say a few words during the presentation? Having the Kane heir speak would mean so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; I scanned the room, noting potential business connections, rivals, useful allies. Victoria&#39;s voice whispering in my head: Always map the battlefield before engaging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I saw them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan and Rose stood near the bar, him uncomfortable in his tuxedo, her resplendent in red silk that probably cost more than most people&#39;s monthly salary. They hadn&#39;t noticed me yet,too busy arguing in fierce whispers behind plastic smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of them still hit like a physical blow. After everything I&#39;d done to destroy their businesses, after the chaos l&#39;d engineered in their lives, they still looked...intact. Together. Rose&#39;s hand still possessively gripping Stefan&#39;s arm. His head still bent attentively toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something ugly twisted in my chest. Not jealousy, I&#39;d moved beyond wanting Stefan back. Something darker. More primitive. The need to see them truly suffer. To watch them crumble completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My opportunity arrived sooner than expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Kane!&#34; Rose&#39;s voice, pitched to carry just the right distance. &#34;What a pleasure to see you again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned slowly, slipping on the mask of polite interest I&#39;d perfected for such moments. &#34;Ms. Lewis. Mr.Rodriguez. Good evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved toward me with the desperate eagerness of drowning people spotting a lifeboat. Rose&#39;s smile too bright, Stefan&#39;s handshake too firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve been hoping to run into you,&#34; Rose gushed,positioning herself closer than social etiquette allowed.&#34;Your charity work is so inspiring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I sipped my champagne, letting silence stretch uncomfortably. Victoria&#39;s first lesson in power dynamics: Make them work for your attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan cleared his throat. &#34;Ms. Kane, I wanted to apologize if I seemed distracted when we met at the gallery opening. Business concerns, you understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; I studied him with cool detachment. &#34;I&#39;ve heard Rodriguez Shipping is facing... challenges.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face tightened.&#34;Temporary setbacks. Nothing we can&#39;t overcome with the right partnerships.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rose jumped in smoothly. &#34;Which is actually something we hoped to discuss. Your mother mentioned Kane Industries might be looking for shipping partners in the Asian markets?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their desperation was palpable, hanging in the air between us like cheap perfume. It took everything l had not to smile at the beautiful irony. Here they stood, begging for help from the very woman they&#39;d destroyed, seeking salvation from the architect of their downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kane Industries is always exploring new opportunities,&#34;I replied, noncommittal. &#34;Though we have very strict criteria for potential partners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rodriguez Shipping has an impeccable reputation,&#34;Stefan insisted, leaning forward, eyes intense. The same eyes that had once looked into mine with false promises of forever.&#34;Three generations of excellence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three generations,&#34; I mused. &#34;Such a shame to see that legacy threatened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flinched as if I&#39;d struck him. &#34;The company will recover. With the right support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And your fashion line, Ms. Lewis?&#34; I turned to Rose. &#34;I understand you&#39;re also seeking investors?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her perfect smile faltered slightly. &#34;Word travels fast in New York. Yes, we&#39;re in expansion talks with several interested parties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How interesting;&#34; I took another sip of champagne.&#34;Given the recent quality issues reported in fashion blogs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Malicious rumors.&#34; Her voice hardened even as her smile remained fixed. &#34;Competitors trying to damage my brand&#39;s reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Competitors can be so... ruthless.&#34; I let my gaze drift over her shoulder, dismissive. &#34;The business world is unforgiving that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rose&#39;s hand tightened on Stefan&#39;s arm, her knuckles whitening. &#34;Ms. Kane, perhaps we could meet privately?Discuss how Kane Industries and our businesses might benefit each other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sheer audacity nearly made me laugh. After everythingthey&#39;d done to me, they expected me to help them? To save them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m afraid my schedule is quite full,&#34; I said, my tone cooling several degrees. &#34;But you&#39;re welcome to submit proposals through our investment division.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve tried.&#34; Stefan&#39;s composure slipped, revealing the desperation beneath. &#34;Your people won&#39;t return our calls. If you could just put in a word...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A word?&#34; I raised an eyebrow. &#34;From me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your influence with Victoria Kane is well-known,&#34;Rose pressed, stepping closer. The scent of her perfume, the same one she&#39;d worn when comforting me after Stefan became distance during our marriage,made my stomach turn. &#34;Just a small recommendation.An introduction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I studied them both, savoring the moment. The great Rose Lewis and Stefan Rodriguez, reduced to begging for scraps of attention. For a moment, I allowed myself to imagine telling them everything. Removing my careful mask and watching recognition dawn in their eyes. Seeing them understand exactly who held their fate in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the time wasn&#39;t right. The game wasn&#39;t finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll consider it,&#34; I said finally. &#34;Though I should warn you,my mother values loyalty above all else. She has little patience for those who... discard their commitments when convenient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan&#39;s face paled slightly. Did he hear the accusation beneath my words? Did some part of him sense who was really standing before him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We understand,&#34; Rose said quickly. &#34;Loyalty is everything to us as well. Family values are the foundation of both our businesses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hypocrisy burned like acid. Family values? From the woman who had systematically destroyed her sister&#39;s life? Who had likely arranged her &#34;accident&#34;when convenient?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How fortunate for you both.&#34; I glanced past them,signaling the conversation&#39;s end. &#34;If you&#39;ll excuse me,the hospital director is waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; Rose reached for my hand, squeezing it with false warmth. &#34;Thank you for considering our request. It means everything to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I allowed the contact, though every cell in my body screamed to pull away. &#34;I&#39;m sure it does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I moved through the crowd, their eyes followed me.I felt their desperate hope, their growing fear.I had become what they never expected, someone with power over them. Someone who could save or destroy their carefully built world with a single word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria waited near the stage, regal in black Chanel.&#34;Productive conversation?&#34; she asked, having observed the entire exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very.&#34; I accepted another glass of champagne from a passing waiter. &#34;They&#39;re desperate. The Asian shipping routes collapse hit them harder than we anticipated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; Satisfaction glinted in Victoria&#39;s eyes.your fashion line attack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rose is panicking. Trying to hide it, but she&#39;s losing clients. The quality control rumors we spread are gaining traction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excellent.&#34; Victoria&#39;s smile held all the warmth of a predator spotting prey. &#34;And your... personal reaction?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question caught me off guard. Victoria rarely concerned herself with emotions, focusing instead on strategy and results.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They don&#39;t recognize me,&#34; I said carefully. &#34;Even up close. Even with time to study my face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course they don&#39;t. Dr. Torres&#39; work was impeccable.&#34; Victoria watched me closely. &#34;But that wasn&#39;t what I asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met her gaze directly. &#34;It felt... powerful. Seeing them beg for help from the woman they tried to destroy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, apparently satisfied. &#34;Remember that feeling. It&#39;s why we&#39;re doing this. Why all the preparation matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as I followed her toward the stage for the evening&#39;s presentations, I wondered if power alone was what I&#39;d felt. Beneath the satisfaction,something else lurked. Something that had stirred when Stefan&#39;s eyes met mine, searching for help I would never give.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not regret, exactly. Not compassion. But a shadow of the woman I&#39;d once been. The woman who had loved without reservation. Who had believed in second chances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That woman was gone, I reminded myself.Transformed by betrayal and Victoia&#39;s careful guidance into someone stronger. Someone who would never again be victim to their manipulations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I took the podium to speak about Kane Industries &#39; commitment to helping children, I spotted them watching from the crowd. Rose&#39;s calculating gaze.Stefan&#39;s desperate hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them would sleep well tonight,wondering if Camille Kane would throw them a lifeline or let them drown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought brought a genuine smile to my face as l began my speech.</p>
