                <p>Camille&#39;s phone buzzed against the boardroom table,its vibration cutting through her presentation. She glanced at the screen and felt her stomach drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me,&#34; she said, her voice steadier than she felt. &#34;Let&#39;s take a five-minute break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the engineering team filed out, Camille opened the alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*BREAKING: Kane.Industries (KI) down 8.7% on rumors of Phoenix Grid safety concerns*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scrolled quickly to a financial blog post: &#34;SOURCES CLAIM PHOENIX GRID POSES UNPRECEDENTED FIRE RISK.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The article cited &#34;anonymous whistleblowers inside Kane Engineering&#34; who allegedly provided documents showing the power distribution nodes could overheat under certain conditions. The claims were vague but specific enough to sound credible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille called Victoria. No answer. She tried Alexander next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve seeniit,&#34;he said immediately. &#34;PR is already crafting a response.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who would do this?&#34; Camille demanded, pacing the empty boardroom. &#34;Three days before groundbreaking? This isn&#39;t coincidence.&#34;⑤</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander agreed, his voice tight. &#34;It&#39;s coordinated. The same story appeared simultaneously on four different financial platforms. Our stock dropped the moment markets opened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille glanced at the wall of glass. Engineers huddled nearby, faces worried, stealing glances toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get Hannah Zhao on this immediately,&#34; she ordered. &#34;I want a comprehensive safety report ready by this afternoon-something clear enough for the media to understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Already happening,&#34; Alexander assured her. &#34;Victoria&#39;s called an emergency press conference for two o&#39;clock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille checked her watch: 10:17 AM. Less than four hours to contain a crisis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>미며 be there,&#34; she said. &#34;I need to finish with the engineering team first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Camille,&#34; Alexander&#39;s voice softened. &#34;This will pass. The Phoenix Grid is sound.We both know that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ended the call, took a deep breath, and opened the door to call back the engineers. Their anxious faces told her rumors had already spread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assume you&#39;ve all heard,&#34; she said directly. &#34;Let me be clear: The Phoenix Grid design is sound. These allegations are baseless. But we will address them with facts, not defensiveness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hannah Zhao, the lead engineer, stepped forward. &#34;The distribution nodes have been tested far beyond normal parameters. They simply cannot cause fires as described.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone fabricated concerns,&#34; Camille agreed. &#34;Our job now is to prove it. Hannah, I need your team to prepare a comprehensive safety assessment. Every test, every safety margin, every redundancy. Two o&#39;clock deadline.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the team dispersed, Hannah lingered behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Kane,&#34; she said quietly, &#34;these allegations contain technical details that only someone with inside knowledge could know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The implication hung in the air. A leak. A betrayal from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m aware,&#34; Camille replied.&#34;Let&#39;s focus on the facts first. We&#39;ll deal with how this happened afterward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two floors below, Victoria Kane stood in her office, watching financial news coverage. The ticker showed Kane Industries down 11.3%. She held her phone to her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find out who&#39;s behind this,&#34; she ordered. &#34;Check trading patterns. Someone is profitingfrom this drop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ended the call as her assistant entered with printouts of every article mentioning the allegations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The technical team is preparing a detailed response,&#34; the assistant reported. &#34;And Mr.Pierce is on his way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria scanned the articles. Something in the phrasing caught her attention, targeting not just the technology but subtly undermining Camille&#39;s judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed. This had Rose&#39;s fingerprints all over it. But Rose had been in hiding since the press conference disaster. This attack was too well-orchestrated for Rose alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had help. Significant help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexander arrived, Victoria didn&#39;t bother with greetings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a coordinated attack,&#34; she said, handing him the most damaging article. &#34;Look at the technical specifics, someone with engineering knowledge helped prepare this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander scanned the document. &#34;The details are close enough to our actual specs to sound legitimate,but with key differences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Suggesting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone with partial knowledge,&#34; he concluded. &#34;Not current blueprints, but perhaps earlier versions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria moved to the window. &#34;I want every former employee with technical knowledge investigated. Every contractor,every consultant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Already underway,&#34; Alexander assured her. &#34;Security is also checking for digital breaches.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Rose?&#34; Victoria turned back. &#34;What&#39;s she been doing since the press conference?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shook his head. &#34;Gone dark. No credit card usage, no phone activity. She&#39;s effectively disappeared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody disappears that completely without help,&#34; Victoria observed. &#34;Someone is sheltering her, funding her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The question is who,&#34; Alexander agreed. &#34;And why target the Phoenix Grid specifically?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoría&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;Because it&#39;s Camille&#39;s project. Her vision. Her redemption. Attacking it is personal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Káne Industries press room buzzed with media activity. Television cameras lined the back wall as reporters filled every seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille stood backstage, reviewing her notes. Victoria beside her, both women dressed in nearly identical charcoal suits, a united front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember,&#34; Victoria said quietly, &#34;no defensiveness. No anger. Just facts, confidence, and absolute certainty in our technology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander appeared, tablet in hand. &#34;Hannah&#39;s report is ready. Comprehensive, clear, and irrefutable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who leaked the specifications?&#34; Camille asked, keeping her voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shook his head. &#34;Not yet. But the technical details weren&#39;t entirely accurate, close enough to seem legitimate, but with key differences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meaning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone with partial knowledge,&#34; he clarified. &#34;Not a current insider with full access.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille&#39;s mind immediately went to Rose. &#34;It&#39;s her. Rose is behind this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s expression remained neutral. &#34;Focus on the present crisis. We&#39;ll deal with the source later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lights seemed unnaturally bright as Camille approached the podium, Victoria and Alexander flanking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good afternoon,&#34; Camille began, her voice clear and strong.&#34;I&#39;m here to address rumors regarding the Phoenix Grid technology. These allegations are categorically false, based on misunderstood or.deliberately manipulated information.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gestured to the screen showing Hannah&#39;s safety report in simplified graphic form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Phoenix Grid distribution nodes have been tested at three times maximum operational temperature without any safety concerns. The fire risk described is technically impossible given our design specifications.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reporter called out: &#34;Why would whistleblowers make these claims if there&#39;s no substance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille met his gaze directly. &#34;We&#39;ve found no evidence these &#39;whistleblowers&#39; exist. These rumours appeared simultaneously across multiple platforms, a coordinated attack, not a genuine safety concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you suggesting corporate sabotage?&#34; another reporter asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m stating facts,&#34; Camille replied coolly. &#34;The Phoenix Grid has undergone rigorous testing by independent laboratories. Those results are publicly available.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued dismantling the allegations point by point. When technical questions arose, Hannah Zhao offered precise explanations that reassured without overwhelming the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the press conference ended, the stock had stabilized, regaining two percentage points.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they exited, Alexander showed Camille his tablet, social media sentiment shifting as technical experts confirmed their safety claims.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crisis contained,&#34; he said, relief evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now,&#34; Camille replied,unable to shake her unease. &#34;This was too well-planned to be a one-time attack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded. &#34;I&#39;ve assigned a team to trace the source. If there&#39;s a connection to Rose, we&#39;ll find it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s behind this,&#34; Camille insisted as they walked toward the elevator. &#34;I can feelit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if she is,&#34; Victoria interjected, &#34;Rose lacks the resources and technical knowledge to execute something this sophisticated alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator doors closed, sealing the three of them in privacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then she has help,&#34; Camille said, frustration edging her voice. &#34;Someone with money, influence, and a grudge against Kane Industries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That describes half of Wall Street,&#34; Victoria replied dryly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s phone buzzed. He checked it, his expression turning grim. &#34;Security reports unusual access attempts on out engineering servers last night. Nothing breached, but someone was probing for weaknesses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille felt cold certainty settle in her stomach. &#34;This is just the beginning, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Victoria nor Alexander contradicted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>** **</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, Victoria called Camille and Alexander to her private office. The large circular room, with its panoramic views of Manhattan, felt like a war room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The final damage report,&#34; Victoria began, sliding tablets across her desk. &#34;Stock closed down six percent.Four institutional investors have expressed &#39;concerns&#39; about the Phoenix Grid. Two regulators have requested additional safety documentation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander reviewed the information. &#34;Better than we feared, worse than we hoped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The press conference helped,&#34; Victoria acknowledged. &#34;But doubt has been planted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille scrolled through the reports. &#34;Has security made any progress identifying the source?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing concrete,&#34; Victoria admitted. &#34;But the timing is too perfect to be coincidence. Three days before groundbreaking,just as final preparations are underway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone knows our schedule intimately,&#34; Alexander added. &#34;Someone with access to internal planning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to investigate everyone with access to the Phoenix Grid specifications,&#34;Camille said.&#34;Current employees, former employees, contractors, suppliers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Already in progress,&#34; Victoria assured her. &#34;But this feels personal, Camille. Targeted specifically at your project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rose,&#34; Camille said, the name like acid on her tongue. &#34;She&#39;s been silent too long. This is exactly her style,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wait until I feel secure, then strike where it hurts most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander leaned forward. &#34;Rose lacks the technical expertise to understand the Phoenix Grid specifications.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t need to understand them,&#34; Camille countered. &#34;She just needs to find someone whno does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s expression remained thoughtful. &#34;The questionis how she&#39;s executing it, and who&#39;s helping her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood. &#34;We should consider postponing the groundbreaking ceremonies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Camille said firmly. &#34;That&#39;s exactly what they want. If we delay, it only validates the rumors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria studied her, approval flickering in her eyes. &#34;Agreed. We proceed as planned, but with enhanced security.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to find Rose,&#34; Camille said suddenly.&#34;Look her in the eye, see what she&#39;s planning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too risky,&#34; Victoria responded immediately. &#34;Drawing her out now could accelerate whatever. she&#39;s planning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or disrupt it,&#34; Camille argued. &#34;Rose has always been reactive. If she sees me unafraid, it might force her to make a mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander returned to the table. &#34;If we could locate Rose, approaching her would need to be handled carefully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;You&#39;re considering this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m considering all options,&#34; he corrected. &#34;Including that drawing Rose into the open might reveal who&#39;s 0backing her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille felt a surge of gratitude toward Alexander. &#34;We know Rose. She can&#39;t resist gloating. If I confront her directly, she&#39;ll reveal something, even unintentionally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria remained unconvinced. &#34;And if it&#39;s a trap? If she wants you to find her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we set a counter-trap,&#34; Camille replied. &#34;But sitting here waiting for the next attack isn&#39;t working.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three fell silent, each weighing the risks. Outside, darkness had fallen over the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find her,&#34; Victoria said finally. &#34;But do not approach without a full security plan. And Alexander goes with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille nodded,accepting the conditions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now,&#34; Victoria continued, &#34;the Phoenix Grid groundbreaking proceeds in three days. I want hourly security checks at all sites, background rechecks on all personnel, and additional testing on every component.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Already implemented,&#34; Alexander assured her. &#34;Nothing will go wrong at the ceremony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See that it doesn&#39;t,&#34; Victoria replied, her tone leaving no room for failure. &#34;The Phoenix Grid represents more than just a business venture. It&#39;s Camille&#39;s statement to the world, that she builds rather than destroys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille felt the weight of Victoria&#39;s words. The Phoenix Grid wasn&#39;t just about energy distribution, it was about her transformation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll find who&#39;s behind this,&#34; she promised. &#34;And we&#39;ll stop them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander reached for her hand under the table, a small gesture of support invisible to Victoria. &#34;Together,&#34;he added quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille squeezed his hand in response, drawing strength from his presence. Rose might have help,resources, planning, but Camille had something stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had truth on her side. And she would not be defeated again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get to work,&#34; she said, rising from her chair. &#34;We have a groundbreaking to prepare for, and a sister to find.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded, herexpression warming slightly as she watched her protégé. &#34;Tomorrow morning, eight o&#39;clock. Full team briefing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Camille and Alexander left Victoria&#39;s office, uncertainty still hungin the air. But something else was there too, a renewed sense of purpose, of unity in the face of this invisible threat. Whatever came next, they would face it together.</p>
