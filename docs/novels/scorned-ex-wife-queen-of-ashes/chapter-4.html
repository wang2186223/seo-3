                <p>STEFAN&#39;S POINT OF VIEW</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scotch burned going down, but I poured another anyway. My third? Fourth? I&#39;d lost count somewhere between signing those divorce papers and watching Camille walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our wedding photo still sat on my desk, mocking me.Camille&#39;s genuine smile, my distracted eyes, already looking past her, always looking for Rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even her name felt like betrayal now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone lit up with another message from her:&#34;Darling, stop drinking and come over. We should celebrate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celebrate. Like we hadn&#39;t just destroyed someone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>who loved us. Someone who&#39;d given me three years of devotion I never deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory hit me like a punch to the gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stefan?&#34; Camille&#39;s voice was small, uncertain. &#34;Did I do something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up from my laptop, irritated at the interruption. She stood in the doorway of my home office, holding a plate of something that smelled amazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made that pasta you mentioned. The one with truffles?&#34; Her eyes were hopeful. &#34;Rose gave me the recipe...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course she had. Rose had made that pasta for me in Rome, years ago. Back when we were...whatever we were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m busy.&#34; | didn&#39;t even look at the plate. &#34;Just leave it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; A pause. &#34;It&#39;s just, you&#39;ve been working late all week,and I thought...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Camille.&#34; My voice sharp with an anger that wasn&#39;t really meant for her. &#34;I said I&#39;m busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left the plate and disappeared, quiet as always.The pasta sat untouched until morning, a perfect recreation of a memory that belonged to another woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurled my glass at the wall, watching crystaI shatter like the life I&#39;d built on lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>God, I&#39;d been cruel. Not just at the end, but throughout our marriage. Every missed dinner, every forgotten anniversary, every time l&#39;d chosen work over her, all excuses to avoid the guilt of wanting her sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed again. Mother this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling, I just heard from Rose. Are you alright? Do you need anything? I always said Camille wasn&#39;t suited for our family...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I silenced the phone, remembering another moment I&#39;d tried to forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s trying so hard, Stefan.&#34; Rose&#39;s voice was gentle as she poured me another drink. We were alone in my office after another disastrous family dinner. &#34;Maybe if you gave her more guidance...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like you did?&#34; I couldn&#39;t keep the bitterness from my voice. &#34;Teaching her all the ways to be perfect?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rose&#39;s laugh was musical, practiced. Everything about her was practiced. &#34;Are you saying you preferred me imperfect?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air between us crackled with unspoken history.Four years of passion and plans, ended by her sudden departure to London. Or so she&#39;d claimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you really leave?&#34; The question slipped out,colored by whiskey and old pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know why.&#34; She touched my cheek, familiar and forbidden. &#34;Camille needed a chance at happiness.We both agreed...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had we? I couldn&#39;t remember anymore. Everything from that time felt hazy, manipulated. Like watching a play where I&#39;d forgotten my lines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She loves you,&#34; Rose whispered, too close now.&#34;More than I ever could.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her eyes said something different. They always had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another memory surfaced, this one from last week.The moment everything changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| made your favorite breakfast.&#34; Camille&#39;s smile was bright, genuine. Always so damn genuine. &#34;Happy anniversary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The divorce papers burned in my briefcase, Rose&#39;s perfume still lingering on my clothes from our late-night &#34;meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t.&#34; | grabbed my keys, avoiding her eyes. &#34;Early meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; Her voice cracked slightly. &#34;Will you be home for dinner? I thought we could...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t wait up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d spent that evening with Rose, planning how to break the news. She&#39;d worn the same perfume she&#39;d worn in Rome, all those years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s kinder this way,&#34; she&#39;d said, stroking my hair. &#34;A clean break. Camille will understand eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would she? The look in her eyes when she&#39;d seen Rose&#39;s photo...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My office door opened, startling me from the memory. Mother stood there, perfectly coiffed even at midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really, darling. Drinking alone in the dark?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not now,Mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clicked across the room, surveying the broken glass with disapproval. &#34;Rose is worried about you.We all are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Worried?&#34; I laughed, harsh and broken. &#34;Like you were worried about Camille all these years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That girl was never right for you.&#34; Mother&#39;s voice hardened. &#34;Rose, on the other hand...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop.&#34; I stood, unsteady. &#34;Just... stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stefan Rodriguez, you will not speak to me that way.I raised you better...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you?&#34; The words exploded out of me. &#34;You raised me to what? String along a woman who loved me while pining for her sister? Listen to you tear her down at every opportunity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mother stepped back, shocked. In twenty eight years, I&#39;d never raised my voice to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything she did was wrong, wasn&#39;t it?&#34; I continued, the scotch making me brave. &#34;Her clothes, her manners, her cooking. Nothing was ever good enough. But Rose... Rose was perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because she understands our world!She...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She understands manipulation.&#34; The truth hit me like a freight train. &#34;She played us all. You, me, Camille...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be ridiculous.&#34; Mother straightened her designer jacket. &#34;Rose loves you. She always has.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she? Or had she loved the game more?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered the cold calculation in her eyes when she&#39;d orchestrated our &#34;chance&#34; meetings after returning from London. The way she&#39;d encouraged Camille&#39;s insecurities while playing the supportive sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even our reunion two months ago felt staged now.The charity gala, Camille conveniently&#34;sick,&#34; Rose in that dress I&#39;d loved in Rome...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother.&#34; I sank back into my chair, suddenly exhausted.&#34;Please leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stefan...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go. Tell Rose... tell her...&#34; What? That I wvas sorry?That I finally saw through her perfect mask? That I&#39;d destroyed my marriage for a fantasy she&#39;d carefully crafted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mother left, her disappointment hanging in the air like expensive perfume. Like Rose&#39;s perfume. Like all the artificial, manipulated pieces of this life I&#39;d chosen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone lit up with another message. Rose again:&#34;Darling, stop being dramatic. Come home.To me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around my office, at the shattered glass and scattered papers. At Camille&#39;s wedding photo,her genuine smile now seeming like an accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had I done?</p>
