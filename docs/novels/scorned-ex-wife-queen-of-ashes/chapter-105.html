                <p>Victoria&#39;s hands shook as she poured herself a drink in her office. The setting sun cast long shadows across the room. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, New York City sparkled, unaware of the storm brewing among its towering buildings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Herod Preston,&#34; Victoria whispered the name like a curse, staring into her glass. &#34;After all these years...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille had never seen Victoria like this, unsteady, shaken to her core. Since Alexander had revealed Rose&#39;s partner at the groundbreaking, Victoria had barely spoken, rushing them back to Kane Industries headquarters with security doubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to tell me everything,&#34; Camille said. &#34;Who is he? What does he want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria drained her glass in one swallow. &#34;Herod Preston is the younger brother of Charles Preston. The man who was engaged to my daughter Sophia before her death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set her glass down with a sharp click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charles Preston&#39;s family owned Preston Shipping, once a rival to Kane Industries. They were old money,very powerful. They didn&#39;t approve of Charles marrying Sophia. When they couldn&#39;t break the engagement,they arranged her car accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood by the window, listening silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You told me this before,&#34; Camille said softly. &#34;You took revenge on them. Destroyed their company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s laugh held no humor. &#34;I did more than that. I made sure every Preston lost everything. Charles committed suicide six months after Sophia&#39;s death. Their father drank himself to death a year later.&#34; She paused. &#34;But Herod... he was just nineteen when it happened. Away at college. I didn&#39;t pay much attention to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he blames you for what happened to his family,&#34; Alexander said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded. &#34;Apparently. I heard he dropped out after his father died. Disappeared. I assumed he&#39;d gone abroad, living on whatever scraps the family had hidden away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, what did your sources find?&#34; Camille asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander crossed the room, pulling upfiles on his tablet. &#34;Herod Preston has been operating under various aliases for the past decade. He built a fortune in Asia, property development, mostly. Very successful.Very quiet. He returned to the States two years ago and has been buying up companies through shell corporations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did he find Rose?&#34; Camille asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More likely she found him,&#34; Victoria said. &#34;Rose has always had a talent for sniffing out useful allies.And someone hungry for revenge against me would be irresistible to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille rose from her chair. &#34;So this isn&#39;t just about me anymore. Rose brought Herod into this because he wants to hurt you. By targeting the Phoenix Grid, he strikes at both of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyes met Camille&#39;s. &#34;Yes. And Camille, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve put you in danger. Again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The raw pain in Victoria&#39;s voice stripped away years of her carefully constructed armor. In that moment, she wasn&#39;t the powerful CEO, the vengeful mother, the calculating mentor. She was simply a woman frightened of losing another daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille crossed the room and knelt beside Victoria&#39;s chair, taking her cold hands. &#34;No. Don&#39;t you dare blame yourself. Rose is my fight. She&#39;s been my fight since she tried to kill me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Herod...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Herod made his choice when he partnered with Rose. When he targeted the Phoenix Grid.&#34; Camille squeezed Victoria&#39;s hands. &#34;We&#39;ve faced enemies before. We&#39;ll face this one too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria shook her head. &#34;You don&#39;t understand. The Prestons were different. Charles was... unstable.Brilliant but unhinged. Herod was always the same, quieter, more calculating. If he&#39;s spent ten years planning this...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we&#39;ll spend however long it takes stopping him,&#34; Camille finished firmly. She stood up. &#34;I won&#39;t let you fight him alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria looked up, surprise flashing across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From the moment you found me in that parking garage, you&#39;ve fought for mne,&#34;Camille continued.&#34;You reshaped me. Gave me purpose. A new life. Everything I am now, I owe to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Camille...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, let me finish.&#34; Camille&#39;s voice grew stronger. &#34;You taught me to never show weakness. To always strike first. To use every resource at my disposal.&#34; She placed her hand over Victoria&#39;s. &#34;Well, now I&#39;m using the most valuable resource I have, you. We fight together. We win together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stepped closer. &#34;She&#39;s right, Victoria. Divided, Herod and Rose can pick us off one by one.Together, they don&#39;t stand a chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyes moved between them, something shifting in her expression. Slowly, the familiar steel returned to her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Together,&#34; she repeated, as if testing the word.&#34;It&#39;s been a long time since I trusted anyone enough to fight alongside them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then it&#39;s about time you started,&#34; Camille said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stood, smoothing her suit jacket. &#34;They&#39;ll expect us to be defensive now. To focus on protecting the Grid. Especially after the groundbreaking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded. &#34;Which means we need to be offensive instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly.&#34; Victoria moved to her desk, pressing the intercom. &#34;Sarah, get me the files on all Preston family holdings from ten years ago. And schedule a meeting with the legal team for seven AM tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She released the button and turned back to Camille and Alexander. &#34;If Herod&#39;s been operating under aliases,there must be a paper trail somewhere. We find his assets, we find his weaknesses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have my team working through the night,&#34; Alexander said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille watched them shift into strategic mode, but her mind was elsewhere.... on Rose. Rose, who had manipulated everyone since childhood. Rose, who wouldn&#39;t stop until she had destroyed everything Camille loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you thinking?&#34; Victoria asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rose won&#39;t be satisfied with just damaging the Grid,&#34; Camille said slowly.&#34;She wants me to suffer. To watch everything I care about burn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to face them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which means she&#39;ll target the people I love too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyes widened slightly.&#34;You think she&#39;ll go after Alexander? Or me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eventually. Yes.&#34; Camille&#39;s throat tightened. &#34;Rose has always wanted what I have. She took Stefan. She tried to take my family, my reputation, my status. Now she&#39;ll want to take...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander crossed the room in three quick strides, taking her face in his hands. &#34;Let her try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His touch anchored her, pushing back the wave of fear threatening to drown her. In his eyes, she saw not just affection but fierce determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not Stefan,&#34; he said quietly. &#34;I won&#39;t be manipulated. I won&#39;t be turned. And I&#39;m a lot harder to get rid of than she thinks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria watched them, then opened her desk drawer and removed something small and silver. She held it out to Camille, a pin in the shape of a knight chess piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was going to give you this after the Grid went online,&#34; Victoria said.&#34;The knight, the piece that moves differently than all the others. The piece that can leap over obstacles. The piece that&#39;s most dangerous when it&#39;s underestimated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille took the pin, feeling its weight in her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now I think you need it sooner,&#34; Victoria continued. &#34;To remind you that sometimes the best move isn&#39;t the obvious one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Camille said, pinning it beside her phoenix emblem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria straightened. &#34;We&#39;ll need to move quickly. I want twenty-four-hour security on all of us. Full background checks on everyone working on the Grid project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Done,&#34; Alexander said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Rose?&#34; Camille asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s mouth tightened. &#34;We need to draw her out. Force her to show her hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By giving her something she can&#39;t resist.&#34; Victoria rubbed her temples.&#34;What does Rose want more than anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Todestroy me,&#34; Camille said. &#34;To take everything I have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. And right now, what&#39;s most important to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Phoenix Grid.&#34; Camille understood immediately.&#34;We make her think we&#39;ve discovered a flaw in the system. Something that could delay the launch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded. &#34;A carefully leaked internal memo suggesting security concerns. Technical problems that need addressing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rose will think her sabotage was discovered,&#34; Camille continued,&#34;buut not completely understood. She&#39;ll want to know exactly what we found, and what we missed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Herod will want to adjust his timeline,&#34; Victoria added. &#34;They&#39;ll need to communicate, to coordinate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which gives us a chance to track them,&#34;Alexander finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression remained troubled. &#34;What about your relationship? The press is already speculating after the groundbreaking ceremony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria studied them both. &#34;You&#39;re not ready to go public.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Not yet. Not like this.&#34; Camille exchanged a glance with Alexander.&#34;What we have is too new, too personal to use as a strategic move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t want Rose targeting it specifically,&#34; Alexander added. &#34;Better to keep it private, protected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded. &#34;I understand. Some weapons are best kept sheathed until the perfect moment. We&#39;ll find another way to draw them out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille felt relief wash through her. What was growing between her and Alexander felt precious, fragile despite its strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s gaze sharpened. &#34;Don&#39;t thank me yet. This fight is just beginning, and it will get much worse before it ends. Herod Preston spent a decade rebuilding from nothing. That kind of patience, that level of determination...&#34; She shook her head. &#34;He won&#39;t be easily defeated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither will we,&#34; Camille said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria smiled then, a real smile that transformed her face. &#34;No. We won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Alexander. &#34;Have your team leak that internal memo first thing tomorrow. Make it seem accidental, an email sent to the wrong distribution list, perhaps.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Consider it done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria moved toward the door. &#34;Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I need to make some calls.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the doorway, she paused, looking back at Camille. &#34;Camille... thank you. For saying you won&#39;t let me fight alone. It&#39;s been a very long time since anyone stood with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Camille could respond, Victoria was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander took Camille&#39;s hand. &#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO,&#34;she admitted. &#34;I&#39;m scared. Not for myself, but for her. For you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; Alexander said gently, pulling her closer. &#34;Remember what you told Victoria? Together. We fight together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides,&#34; he added, a hint of steelentering his voice, &#34;Rose may think she knows you. But she has no idea who I am. What I&#39;m capable of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille caught a glimpse of something hard and dangerous beneath his usual controlled exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been fighting for me from the shadows all this time,&#34; she said softly. &#34;Now we fight side by side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Side by side,&#34; he agreed. &#34;No more operating separately. No more secrets between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone buzzed. He frowned at the screen.team found something. Herod has been moving large sums to offshore accounts. Recently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It means he&#39;s preparing for something big.&#34; Alexander&#39;s eyes met hers.&#34;Camille, whatever&#39;s coming... it&#39;s coming soon,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She touched the knight pinat her lapel.&#34;Then we&#39;ll be ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even as she spoke the words, a whisper of doubt curled through her mind. Rose had alway/s been one step ahead. And now, with Herod Preston beside her, with resources and hatred fueling them both...</p>
