                <p>Chapters seven through twelve before tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, though the thought of more studying after today&#39;s schedule made me want to scream.Or cry.Or both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lunch with the Vanity Fair editor was a special kind of torture. Maintaining my new identity while answering personal questions about a childhood that never happened required constant vigilance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what was it like, growing up as Victoria Kane&#39;s secret daughter?&#34; she asked, recorder running between our plates at the exclusive restaurant Victoria had chosen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave the practiced answer, natural enough to sound genuine. &#34;Private. Sheltered. Mom was always concerned about my safety, especially after what happened to her first family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The editor leaned forward eagerly.&#34;Yes, the tragic accident that claimed her husband and son. You would have been, what, eight when that happened?&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ten,&#34; I corrected smoothly, though in reality, I&#39;d been thirteen when Victoria&#39;s family died, a fact I&#39;d memorized from public records rather than personal experience. &#34;Too young to fully understand, but old enough to see how it changed her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And being sent abroad afterward? That must have been difficult.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wanted me safe,&#34; I replied, the rehearsed explanation flowing naturally now. &#34;The isolation was challenging, but it forged independence. Mother always says strength grows from discomfort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The editor scribbled notes, clearly loving the narrative of the mysterious heiress emerging from seclusion.By the time lunch ended, she&#39;d extracted enough quotes for a glowing profile that would further cement my new identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked my watch as her taxi pulled away. Twenty minutes to reach Madame Rousseau&#39;s language studio.Not enough time to rest. Never enough time.</p>
