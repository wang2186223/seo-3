                <p>The executive boardroom of Kane Industries buzzed with restrained energy as financial analysts and legal experts gathered around the massive oak table. All eyes focused on the presentation screen where Fabio Moretti&#39;s company logo, Moretti Global Logistics, dominated the display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria Kane sat at the head of the table, silver hair swept into her signature severe bun. To her right,Camille Kane studied the financiaI projections,occasionally making notes on her tablet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Howard, please begin,&#34; Victoria said, nodding to the head of acquisitions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniel Howard cleared his throat. &#34;Moretti Global Logistics is the primary shipping partner for Rose Lewis Designs, or what remains of it. They handle eighty-seven percent of the brand&#39;s global transportation needs, plus warehousing and fulfillment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clicked to the next slide showing a world map dotted with distribution centers. &#34;Moretti has built impressive infrastructure across twenty-three countries, specializing in high-end fashion logistics.Their client list includes Chanel, Versace, and numerous luxury brands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And their financial situation?&#34; Victoria prompted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Overleveraged,&#34; Howard replied, advancing to a declining profit graph. &#34;They expanded aggressively last year, taking on significant debt. With Lewis Designs&#39; collapse, they&#39;ve lost thirty percent of expected revenue. Their stock has dropped eighteen percent in the past week alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria turned to legal. &#34;Ms. Chen, the ownership structure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor Chen opened her folder. &#34;Fifty-one percent owned by Fabio Moretti himself. Twenty-two percent public shareholders. The remaining twenty-seven percent held by various private investors, including a fifteen percent stake belonging to Rose Lewis, who joined their board last year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A murmur ran through the room. Victoria silenced it with a glance before turning to her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Camille,your assessment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes shifted to the younger Kane, who set down her tablet with deliberate care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Moretti Global represents a strategic opportunity on multiple levels,&#34; Camille began coolly. &#34;First, their infrastructure complements our existing holdings.Second, their client relationships give us immediate entry into luxury fashion shipping. Third, their vulnerability makes this the optimal moment to acquire them below market value.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, meeting her mother&#39;s gaze. &#34;And fourth,Fabio Moretti is Rose Lewis&#39;s godfather and most loyal business ally. The last person still standing beside her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The significance settled over the room. Everyone understood this wasn&#39;t purely business. This was personal, another calculated move in the systematic dismantling of Rose Lewis&#39;s world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Camille,&#34; Victoria said. &#34;Mr. Howard, the takeover strategy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howard clicked to a flowchart. &#34;We&#39;ve prepared a two-pronged approach. First, quietly acquire available public shares through subsidiaries.Simultaneously, approach private investors,excluding Ms. Lewis, with offers fifteen percent above current value.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Moretti himself?&#34; Victoria asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s where we&#39;ll face resistance,&#34; Howard admitted. &#34;He&#39;s known for loyalty. His connection to the Lewis family goes back decades. He&#39;s unlikely to sell willingly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria turned to research. &#34;Dr. Patel, what vulnerabilities have you identified?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Patel touched her tablet, bringing new information to the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fabio Moretti has three pressure points. First, his son Marco&#39;s struggling startup has been kept afloat through his father&#39;s cash infusions. Second, Moretti Global&#39;s expansion into South America encountered regulatory issues that could be reopened. Third, his youngest daughter is launching a fashion brand next season and needs manufacturing and distribution partners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excellent,&#34; Victoria said. &#34;Leverage without anything too aggressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Implementation timeline?&#34; she asked Howard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We could have controlling interest within thirty days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria shook her head. &#34;Too slow. Rose Lewis resigned yesterday. The embezzlement evidence becomes public tomorrow. Moretti will be preparing contingency plans. We need to move faster.&#34; She turned to Chen. &#34;Legal implications of an immediate tender offer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;d pay a premium and telegraph our intentions,but there&#39;s no legal obstacle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded. &#34;Prepare the offer at twenty percent above current value, contingent on acceptance within forty-eight hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around the table. &#34;Any other considerations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille spoke. &#34;Fabio Moretti has been a second father figure to Rose since childhood. Taking his company will hit her differently than other business losses. This is personal for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria studied her daughter. &#34;Does that concern you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Camille replied steadily. &#34;Just an observation.We should prepare for a more emotional response than her previous losses triggered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stood. &#34;I want the tender offer ready by market close. And ensure Ms. Lewis&#39;s stake is completely isolated in the new structure. I want her investment rendered worthless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executives filed out, leaving Victoria and Camille alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re quiet,&#34; Victoria observed. &#34;Having second thoughts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille shook her head. &#34;No. Just appreciating the precision of it all. How each piece fits so perfectly into the larger strategy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria smiled slightly. &#34;Like chess. The key is thinking multiple moves ahead while your opponent is still reacting to your last action.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Rose Lewis is definitely reacting now,&#34; Camille said with satisfaction. &#34;Her public statement yesterday was a disaster. All that talk about &#39;industry norms&#39; made her sound completely unrepentant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As expected,&#34; Victoria replied. &#34;Rose Lewis has never taken responsibility for anything in her life.&#34; Camille gazed out at the city. &#34;After Moretti Global,what&#39;s left? What else does she have to lose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria joined her at the window. &#34;Her penthouse.Her investments. The remaining shreds of her social standing. But those are merely material losses. The real victory comes when she finally understands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understands what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That someone deliberately orchestrated her destruction. That it wasn&#39;t bad luck or media bias.That someone with patience, resources, and intimate knowledge of her weaknesses methodically took everything she valued.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And when will we reveal that someone was us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria smiled with genuine pleasure. &#34;When it will hurt the most. When she has nothing left but questions about who destroyed her and why.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intercom buzzed. &#34;Ms. Kane, Mr. Moretti is on line one. He&#39;s asking about unusual trading activity in his company&#39;s stock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria and Camille exchanged glances, showing slight surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tel him I&#39;ll speak with him shortly,&#34; Victoria replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He suspects already,&#34; Camille observed. &#34;That complicates things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria shook her head. &#34;It accelerates things.Suspicion creates anxiety. Anxiety leads to poor decisions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want him to panic,&#34; Camille realized admiringly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fear makes the simplest solution more attractive,&#34;Victoria confirmed. &#34;In this case, accepting our offer before he fully understands our intentions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved to Victoria&#39;s office for the call. As Victoria settled behind her desk, Camille took the chair beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember,&#34; Victoria said, &#34;this is business. Not personal. At least as far as Fabio Moretti knows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille composed her features as Victoria initiated the video call. Fabio Moretti appeared, a distinguished Italian man in his sixties with worried eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victoria,&#34; he began without preamble, &#34;what are you doing with my company&#39;s stock?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria remained pleasantly neutral. &#34;Good afternoon,Fabio.I see news travels quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t play games,&#34; he replied,accent thickening with emotion. &#34;Three banks have called about unusual trading patterns. Are you behind this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kane Industries is always exploring acquisition opportunities in complementary sectors,&#34; Victoria replied smoothly. &#34;Your company&#39;s recent expansion aligns with our interests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moretti&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;This isn&#39;t about strategic interests. This is about Rose Lewis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria raised an eyebrow. &#34;I&#39;m not sure l understand the connection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You understand perfectly,&#34; Moretti countered angrily. &#34;First Rodriguez Shipping. Then the Lewis brand. Now my company. You&#39;re systematically destroying everyone connected to Rose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille leaned forward. &#34;Mr. Moretti, business isn&#39;t personal. Our interest in your company is based on infrastructure and client relationships, not personal connections.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moretti studied her with sudden intensity. &#34;You&#39;re Victoria&#39;s daughter. The one who appeared so suddenly last year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Camille Kane,&#34; she confirmed. &#34;I&#39;ve been overseeing our expansion into luxury retail distribution.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something flickered in Moretti&#39;s eyes, a flash of recognition quickly masked. &#34;And now you want my company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We want to discuss a mutually beneficial arrangement,&#34; Victoria interjected. &#34;Your company faces significant challenges after the Lewis brand collapse. We&#39;re prepared to offer stability and growth opportunities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moretti&#39;s face hardened. &#34;My family&#39;s interests include supporting my goddaughter during the worst crisis of her life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Again, you misunderstand our intentions,&#34; Victoria replied cooling. &#34;But since you&#39;ve raised the subject,what do you plan to do with Rose Lewis&#39;s fifteen percent stake now that her business has collapsed and embezzlement charges are forthcoming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Visible shock crossed Moretti&#39;s face.&#34;Embezzlement? What embezzlement?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It hasn&#39;t hit the news yet,&#34; Camille said, almost sympathetically. &#34;But financial irregularities at Lewis Designs have been discovered. Significant funds diverted to personal use. The board will announce tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moretti seemed to age before their eyes. &#34;I don&#39;t believeit. Not Rose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The evidence is quite clear,&#34; Victoria said with false compassion. &#34;I understand this puuts you in a difficult position. Your goddaughter&#39;s reputation in tatters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stake now a liability. And Kane Industries making inquiries about acquisition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused. &#34;Perhaps we should discuss how to move forward in a way that protects what matters most to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moretti&#39;s expression showed the beginning of resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you offering?&#34; he asked finally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A premium on current share values. Continued operational autonomy. And a special consulting contract that would allow you to step back while maintaining influence and income.&#34; Victoria outlined efficiently. &#34;Plus a guaranteed position for your daughter&#39;s new fashion line in our retail distribution network.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of his daughter&#39;s busness caught Moretti&#39;s attention, exactly as intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Rose&#39;s shares?&#34; he asked, voice heavy with conflicted loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that payment would be structured to trigger immediate tax liabilities for Rose while limiting her access to the funds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need time to consider,&#34; Moretti said, though his tone suggested defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; Victoria agreed. &#34;However, our offer is time-sensitive. The formal details will be delivered within the hour, with a forty-eight-hour acceptance window.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moretti nodded distractedly. &#34;I&#39;ll review it with my board.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, Victoria turned to Camille with t.fobo troubles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course he did,&#34; Victoria replied. &#34;He&#39;s known Rose since childhood. What he doesn&#39;t know is that her downfall isn&#39;t random justice but calculated destruction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sent a quick mnessage to the acquisition team.&#34;Proceed with the formal offer immediately.Emphasize the benefits to Moretti&#39;s daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille watched afternoon light glitter against Manhattan&#39;s towers. &#34;Rose will contact him the moment she hears about our offer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Undoubtedly,&#34; Victoria agreed. &#34;But by then, it will be too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Rose loses another person who might have helped her rebuild,&#34; Camille said with satisfaction tinged with complexity. &#34;Another pillar knocked away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria studied her protégée. &#34;Does that trouble you? The systematic isolation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille met her mentor&#39;s gaze directly. &#34;No.It feels like justice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded, pleased. &#34;Precisely. This isn&#39;t merely revenge. This is the universe rebalancing.Every person who enabled Rose Lewis&#39;s deceptions,who helped her build success on lies, they all face consequences now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Including Fabio Moretti,&#34; Camille concluded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Especially Fabio Moretti,&#34; Victoria confirmed.&#34;He knew exactly who Rose Lewis was, yet gave her legitimacy. Made her theft and deception possible through his support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at her watch. &#34;By this time tomorrow,we&#39;ll own controlling interest in Moretti Global Logistics. And Rose Lewis will have lost her godfather&#39;s support, both emotional and financial.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille moved toward the door. &#34;Should I prepare a statement for when the acquisition is announced?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria smiled slightly. &#34;Yes. Something about nd when she realizes what we&#39;ve done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;ll rage. She&#39;ll threaten. She may even try to ght back,&#34; Victoria&#39;s smile widened. &#34;But with what sources? With what allies? With what reputation or redibility?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he answer hung unspoken between them. Rose ewis had nothing left. No company. No supporters.Jo credibility. Nothing but the growing realization hat her destruction had been meticulously planned y someone with intimate knowledge of her ulnerabilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;ll draft the statement,&#34; Camille said, &#34;and prepare for tomorrow&#39;s announcements about the who had never faced consequences for her actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until now.</p>
