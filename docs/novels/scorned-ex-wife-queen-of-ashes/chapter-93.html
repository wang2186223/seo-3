                <p>The executive boardroom of Kane Industries fell silent as Victoria Kane entered, Camnille following close behind. Ten pairs of eyes tracked their movement, calculating and wary. The morning sunlight streaming through the windows did nothing to warm the atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria took her place at the head of the table. Camile sat to her right, feeling the weight of scrutiny press down on her shoulders. She had dressed with particular care that morning-a structured navy suit,minimal jewelry, hair pulled back severely. The outfit of a serious businesswoman, not an unstable heiress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James Whitley, the longest-serving board member, cleared his throat. &#34;Thank you for meeting on such short notice. Given the extraordinary circumstances, we felt immediate discussion was necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s face remained impassive. &#34;The circumstances being?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t play games, Victoria,&#34; snapped Eleanor Price from across the table. The former federal judge had always maintained professional distance. Today, that distance had turned to frost. &#34;Our stock dropped twenty-two percent before trading was halted. The market reopens in three hours. We need answers now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The allegations against Camille are false,&#34; Victoria said, her voice measured but firm.coordinated attack designed to damage Kane Industries through character assassination.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That may be,&#34; said Michael Chen, the soft-spoken CFO. &#34;But market perception is our current reality.Investors are fleeing. Partners are calling with concerns. Three major clients have already requested meetings to discuss &#39;continuity of leadership.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Phoenix Grid launch is two weeks away,&#34; added Diane Rodriguez. &#34;We&#39;ve invested billions. If confidence in the technology collapses along with confidence in...&#34; She hesitated, eyes sliding to Camille.&#34;In leadership, we face an existential threat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille kept her expression neutral. She had prepared for this, rehearsed with Victoria until dawn. Show strength. Show control. Any display of emotion would only reinforce the narrative they were fighting against.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Phoenix Grid technology is sound,&#34; Camille said, speaking for the first time. &#34;The engineering team has verified every aspect. We have redundant testing protocols precisely to prevent any single point of failure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whitley&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;That&#39;s not the concern, Ms. Kane. The concern is whether your... personal situation has compromised your judgment regarding the project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My personal situation?&#34; Camille felt her control slip slightly. &#34;You mean the lies being spread about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Regarding those allegations,&#34; said Eleanor, shuffling papers. &#34;These supposed medical records...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are fabricated,&#34; Victoria cut in.&#34;Obviously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are they? Because their specificity is concerning.&#34; Eleanor read from a document. &#34;Treatment for paranoid delusions at age sixteen. Hospitalization following a violent episode during college. Ongoing therapy for persecution complex. These are detailed claims.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;False claims,&#34; Victoria said, her knuckles whitening around her pen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why haven&#39;t you sued for defamation?&#34; This from Thomas Gordon, the newest board member.&#34;The company&#39;s standard response to false reporting has always been immediate legal action.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyes flashed. &#34;We are gathering evidence on the source of these fabrications before filing.Strategic patience is not inaction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about the interview with Rose Lewis?&#34; Diane pressed. &#34;She made specific claims about witnessing unstable behavior. And now the parents are scheduled to speak tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille felt the blood drain from her face. She hadn&#39;t known about her parents&#39; interview until this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rose Lewis is a proven liar,&#34; Victoria said flatly. &#34;The woman orchestrated an attempt on Camille&#39;s life. Her credibility is non-existent,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The public doesn&#39;t seem to agree,&#34; said Michael, sliding a tablet toward the center. &#34;Social media sentiment analysis shows 68% of public response favors Rose&#39;s version of events.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not running this company based on Twitter polls,&#34; Victoria said, her tone sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, we run it based on market value and shareholder confidence,&#34; Eleanor countered. &#34;Both of which are in freefall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence descended. Camille heard the soft hum of the air conditioning, the muted sounds of the city below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly are you suggesting?&#34; Victoria finally asked, though her tightness around her eyes suggested she already knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James Whitley exchanged glances with the other board members. &#34;The board believes it would be in the company&#39;s best interest if Camile stepped back from her role until this situation resolves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Steps back?&#34; Victoria&#39;s voice remained calm, but Camille saw the tiny muscle jump in her jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Temporarily removes herself from all public-facing duties,&#34; Whitley clarified. &#34;No Phoenix Grid launch appearance. No investor meetings. No press. A leave of absence, effective immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if we refuse this suggestion?&#34; Victoria asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not a suggestion,&#34; Eleanor said coldly. &#34;It&#39;s a decision. The vote was seven to three.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stood slowly. &#34;You held a vote without the CEO?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emergency provision, section 7B of the corporate charter,&#34; Thomas Gordon stated. &#34;When leadership decisions may impact company valuation by more than fifteen percent, the board may convene without full executive presence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;May I remind this board that I hold controlling interest in Kane Industries?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hold sixty percent,&#34; Gordon corrected. &#34;Significant, but not controlling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve led this company through three recessions, two hostile takeover attempts, and countless market fluctuations,&#34; Victoria said, each word precise. &#34;I&#39;ve increased shareholder value by over six hundred percent during my tenure. And you presume to make decisions about my chosen successor without me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t personal, Victoria,&#34; Whitley attempted. &#34;It&#39;s business. The market has spoken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is entirely personal,&#34; Victoria interrupted. &#34;This entire situation stems from a personal vendetta against Camille, and by extension, against me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Regardless of origin,&#34; Eleanor said, &#34;the damage is real. We must contain it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille felt the weight of their judgment. She had prepared to fight external enemies-Rose, the media,public opinion. She hadn&#39;t expected exile from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand the board&#39;s concern, she said, surprising herself with her steady voice. &#34;Kane Industries&#39;success matters more than any individual. Even me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s head snapped toward her, a flash of something crossing her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If stepping back temporarily helps stabilize market confidence,&#34; Camille continued, &#34;I&#39;m willing todo so.On one condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not in a position to make conditions,&#34;Gordon said dismissively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille fixedhim with a stare that made him flinch.&#34;Mycondition is that I remain fully/involved with Phoenix Grid development, even if not publicly. The project needs my oversight to succeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whitley nodded slowly. &#34;That seems reasonable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;James,&#34; Victoria began, a warning in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a sensible compromise, Victoria,&#34; he said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camille turned to Victoria, silently pleading with her to understand. This wasn&#39;t surrender. It was tactical retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Victoria faced the board again. &#34;Very well. Camille will step back from public duties temporarily. All Phoenix Grid operational decisions still run through her. And the company releases a statement today expressing full confidence in her leadership and denouncing these false allegations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor frowned. &#34;The statement should focus on Kane Industries&#39; stability, not personal-&#34; &#34;Those are my terms,&#34; Victoria cut her off. &#34;Take them or I call for a confidence vote on every person at this table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The threat hung in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Whitley conceded after a tense silence. &#34;PR will draft something for your approval.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria stood. &#34;This meeting is adjourned. Camille and I have a company to run. Despite your best efforts to hamstring us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the board members filed out, only James Whitley paused at the door.ctoria, this isn&#39;t personal. We&#39;re trying to protect what you&#39;ve built.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out,&#34; Victoria replied, her voice like ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the door closed, Victoria sank back into her chair, suddenly looking older than Camille had ever seen her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should have prepared you better,&#34;Victoria said. &#34;For what it feels like when the knives come from inside the house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You couldn&#39;t have,&#34; Camille replied.&#34;Some lessons you can only learn by bleeding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyes softened. &#34;You handled that well. Better than I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I gave in. You didn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Victoria shook her head. &#34;You adapted. There&#39;s a difference.&#34; She stared out at the New York skyline.&#34;I&#39;ve watched directors come and go for thirty years. Weathered their challenges, their doubts. But this..This feels different.&#34;	ǜ</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because it is different. This isn&#39;t just business maneuvering. This is Rose. And whoever&#39;s helping her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Herod Preston,&#34; Victoria practically spat the name. &#34;Using Rose to strike at us both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we strike back,&#34; Camille said, resolve strengthening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria studied her face. &#34;They&#39;ll be watching for exactly that. Any sign of &#39;erratic behavior&#39; will only reinforce their narrative.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we do what Kane women do best,&#34; Camille said. &#34;We fight smarter, not harder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hint of a smile touched Victoria&#39;s lips. &#34;You are truly my daughter now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock at the door interrupted them. Victoria&#39;s assistant entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Kane, the PR team is waiting. And... Mr. Pierce called again. He says it&#39;s urgent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell Alexander I&#39;ll call him when I&#39;m finished with PR,&#34; Victoria replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually,&#34; the assistant clarified, &#34;he was asking for Camille.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria and Camille exchanged glances. Alexander had been mysteriously absent since yesterday&#39;s crisis began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take the call in my office,&#34; Victoria said. &#34;I&#39;ll handle PR. We need to get ahead of the board&#39;s decision before it leaks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they prepared to leave, Victoria paused, her hand on Camille&#39;s arm. &#34;Remember what I taught you. When enemies surround you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust no one completely,&#34; Camille finished. &#34;Not even allies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean everyone,&#34; Victoria replied. &#34;Including me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that warning, Victoria swept from the room, shoulders back, head high. As board members scurried from her path, Camille noticed something, the slight tremor in Victoria&#39;s hands, quickly hidden by clenched fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unshakable Victoria Kane was shaken. And that, more than anything else, sent a chill down Camille&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made her way to Victoria&#39;s office, closing the door firmly behind her. Whatever Alexander wanted,whatever new crisis loomed, she would face it with the same strength she&#39;d shown in the boardroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as she reached for the phone, she couldn&#39;t silence the whisper of doubt. If the board could turn on Victoria so quickly, if public opinion could shift against Camille overnight, what other betrayals might be waiting?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who else might be wielding knives in the dark?</p>
