                <p>Rose point of view</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paced my penthouse living room, phone clutched so tightly in my hand that my knuckles turned white.The news notification still glowed on the screen:&#34;Kane Industries Acquires Moretti Global Logistics in Surprise Takeover.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncle Fabio&#39;s company. My last financial lifeline.Gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vodka bottle on the bar called to me, promising temporary relief from the suffocating pressure crushing my chest. Three weeks of systematic destruction had left me raw, exposed, and increasingly desperate. First my company. Then my reputation.Now my godfather&#39;s business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doorbell rang, its shrill tone slicing through my spiraling thoughts. I ignored it, just as l&#39;d beer ignoring most intrusions from the outside world.Probably another reporter hoping to document my &#34;fall from grace&#34; with carefully choreographed photos of the disgraced fashion designer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bell rang again, followed by pounding that made the door shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rose! I know you&#39;re in there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan. I froze, glass halfway to my lips. I hadn&#39;t seen him since the embezzlement news broke, since he&#39;d looked at me with such disgust in my father&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pounding continued. &#34;Open this door, Rose! We need to talk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice held something I&#39;d never heard before,not just anger, but a dangerous edge that sent shivers down my spine. Against my better judgment,I moved to the door and pulled it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan looked terrible. His normally perfect appearance had deteriorated into something almost unrecognizable, wrinkled shirt, dark circles unde:bloodshot eyes, hair uncombed. But it was his expression that truly shocked me, a mixture of fury and something that looked disturbingly like hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why aren&#39;t you answering my calls?&#34; he demanded,pushing past me into the apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello to you too,&#34; I said, trying for sarcasm but achieving only a thin, brittle tone. &#34;Please, come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t a social visit.&#34; He spun to face me. &#34;I just got off the phone with your father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach dropped.&#34;And?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wanted to warn me that you were being difficult about the joint statement. Said you were refusing to sign the paperwork canceling our wedding plans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed my arms defensively. &#34;Why should I? This will all blow over eventually. The media will find someone else to destroy. We can postpone the wedding,not cancel it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan stared at me like I&#39;d grown another head. &#34;Are you serious? After everything that&#39;s happened? After the lies, the affairs, the stolen designs, you still think there&#39;s a future for us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course there is,&#34; I insisted, moving toward him.&#34;People have short memories, Stefan. In six months,no one will care about these ridiculous scandals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ridiculous scandals?&#34; He backed away from my approach. &#34;You stole other designers&#39; work. You slept with married men to advance your career. You embezzled from your own company!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those are just business realities!&#34; Frustration made my voice rise. &#34;Everyone does these things! They only look bad when someone packages them in the most negative light possible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan shook his head, disgust plain on his face. &#34;I don&#39;t even know who you are anymore. The woman I thought I was going to marry wouldn&#39;t recognize these things as &#39;business realities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The woman you thought you were going to marry never existed!&#34; I snapped, anger suddenly boiling over. &#34;She was a character I played because that&#39;s what men like you want, some perfect, supportive accessory who makes you look good at parties!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not fair....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fair?&#34; I laughed, the sound verging on hysterical.&#34;None of this is fair! Someone with unlimited resources has systematically destroyed everything I&#39;ve built! My company, my reputation, my financial security, all gone because someone decided deserved punishment!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you do,&#34; Stefan said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The simple statement stopped me cold. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you deserve exactly what&#39;s happening,&#34;he repeated, voice hardening. &#34;Maybe these &#39;ridiculous scandals&#39; are just your past catching up with you.Maybe this is what justice looks like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Justice?&#34; The word tasted bitter on my tongue. &#34;Is that what you think this is? Someone appointed themselves judge and jury of my life because they &#34;I don&#39;t know what else to call it,&#34; Stefan replied.&#34;Every revelation seems perfectly calculated to expose exactly who you really are. Someone who takes what they want regardless of who gets hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re one to talk about hurting people!&#34; The words burst from me as my control finally shattered. &#34;You were married when we started sleeping together again! You signed divorce papers on your anniversary! You stood beside me at her funeral acting heartbroken when we both knew you were already planning our future!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan stepped back as if l&#39;d physically struck him.&#34;That&#39;s different. I never....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never what? Never lied? Never manipulated? Never caused pain?&#34; | advanced on him, years of carefully hidden resentment suddenly pouring out. &#34;You were so eager to believe the worst about your marriage.So ready to think Camille was boring, unambitious,unsuited to your precious Rodriguez lifestyle. All I had to do was suggest it and you accepted it as truth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it,&#34; Stefan warned, his expression darkening.&#34;Don&#39;t try to make this about our past. This is about who you are now. What you&#39;ve done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who I am?&#34; I laughed, the sound sharp and bitter.&#34;I&#39;m exactly who l&#39;ve always been! The only difference is that now everyone knows it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not true,&#34; Stefan said quietly. &#34;The Rose I thought | knew wouldn&#39;t have stolen designs.Wouldn&#39;t have embezzled money. Wouldn&#39;t have...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t have what?&#34; I challenged, stepping closer until we were inches apart. &#34;Wouldn&#39;t have done everything necessary to get what she wanted?Wouldn&#39;t have removed obstacles in her path?Wouldn&#39;t have made sure her sister&#39;s accident cleared the way for the life we deserved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hung in the air between us, impossible to retract. Stefan&#39;s face drained of color as he stared at me, horror gradually replacing anger in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you just say?&#34; he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too late, I realized what I&#39;d admitted in my fury.My mind raced for explanations, for clarifications, for ways to walk back the implication in my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean.... that came out wrong....&#34; I stammeredd, cold fear replacing hot anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her accident,&#34; Stefan repeated, backing away from me. &#34;You said her accident cleared the way. Like you knew it would happen. Like you arranged it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! That&#39;s not....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you have something to do with Camille&#39;s death?&#34; His voice was barely audible, but each word struck like physical blows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t supposed to be death!&#34; The truth burst from me before I could stop it, the pressure of weeks of destruction finally breaking my control completely.&#34;He was just supposed to scare her! To make her understand she needed to leave! To give up the life that should have been mine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan looked at me as if seeing a stranger, or worse,as if seeing a monster wearing the face of someone he thought he knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; he whispered, horror evident in every syllable. &#34;You arranged the accident that killed her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He went too far,&#34; I said desperately, reaching for him. &#34;It wasn&#39;t supposed to happen that way! She was just supposed to be frightened enough to leave New York, leave you, leave the fashion world I belonged in!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan recoiled from my touch, stumbling backward until he hit the wall. &#34;You had your own sister run off the road?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was ordinary!&#34; The words tore from someplace dark and ugly inside me. &#34;She didn&#39;t deserve you!Didn&#39;t fit into your world! She was holding you back,making you settle for less than you were meant for!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Less than I was meant for,&#34; Stefan repeated, his voice hollow. &#34;And who decided what I was meant for?You?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We belonged together!&#34; I insisted, desperation making me reckless. &#34;We always did! Everything I did was for us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan shook his head slowly, revulsion plain on his face. &#34;There is no &#39;us.!&#39; There never will be again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved toward the door, each step putting more distance between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stefan, wait!&#34; Panic overwhelmed me. &#34;You can&#39;t just leave! We need to talk about this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing to talk about,&#34; he replied, not looking back. &#34;Our engagement is over. Whatever connection we had died the moment you admitted what you did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; I begged, all pride abandoned in the face of complete loss. &#34;I love you! Everything I did.....everything...... was because I love you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stefan paused at the door, turning to look at me one last time. The expression on his face would haunt my nightmares for years to come, not anger, not hatred,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but something worse. Something like pity mixed with profound disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love?&#34; he said quietly. &#34;You don&#39;t know the meaning of the word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door closed behind him with a soft click that somehow hurt more than any slam would have.I stood frozen in the middle of my beautiful penthouse as the full impact of what had just happened crashed over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had admitted my role in Camille&#39;s accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had lost Stefan forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And whoever was systematically destroying my life now had the final piece they needed to complete my ruin.</p>
