                <p>Camille&#39;s point of view</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rose had posted a &#34;tribute&#34; to me, a carefully filtered photo of us as teenagers, her arm around my shoulders, her face glowing while mine was partly in shadow. &#34;Missing my angel sister every day. Your light was too bright for this world. #SisterLove #Forever&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath it, dozens of sympathetic comments. Friends who&#39;d never questioned her role in my marriage&#39;s end. Acquaintances eager to attach themselves to her grief narrative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Stefan, commenting with a simple heart emoji. The man who&#39;d handed me divorce papers on our anniversary,now publicly mourning the wife he&#39;d discarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough,&#34; I said finally, closing the laptop. &#34;I&#39;ve seen what I needed to see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria studied me carefully. &#34;And what do you feel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I searched myself, digging for the hurt, the rage, the betrayal that should be there. Instead, I found something colder, more focused. Like looking at specimens in a lab.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; I answered honestly. &#34;They&#39;re strangers performing in a play.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s smile was approving. &#34;Good. Emotional detachment is essential for what comes next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gestured to the rest of the files on her desk. &#34;Your new life awaits, Camille. Elite education. Investment prodigy. My reclusive adopted daughter finally emerging to take her place in my empire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up my new passport, thumb brushing over the name embossed in gold. Camille Kane. A woman who&#39;d never been hurt by Rose. Never been betrayed by Stefan. Never been overlooked by parents who preferred their adopted daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if someone recognizes me? Someone who knew Camille Lewis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s expression turned serious. &#34;Your new life must be impenetrable. If anyone connects Camille Kane to Camille Lewis, everything we&#39;ve built collapses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do we prevent that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First, appearance.&#34; She gestured to my hair. &#34;Tomorrow morning, our stylists will transform you. New cut,new color, subtle changes that create distance from your former self.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I touched my long brown waves, another piece of the old me about to disappear.&#34;What else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Body language.Speech patterns. The way you walk, the way you hold a glass, the way you respond to questions. We&#39;ve arranged sessions with a behavioral coach who works with intelligence agencies. He&#39;ll help eliminate tells that might connect you to your former self.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thoroughness of the plan was both impressive and terrifying. Victoria had thought of everything,anticipated every potential crack in my new identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And most importantly,&#34; she continued, &#34;limited exposure/to anyone who knew CCamille Lewis. For at least the first year, you&#39;ll avoid any setting where you might encounter old connections.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And after that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s eyes gleamed. &#34;After that, when your new identity is firmly established, when the world has accepted Camille Kane without question, then we begin the real work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened anotherfile, this one containing financial reports, business plans, investment portfolios.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rose has expanded her boutique into a small fashion line. She&#39;s seeking five million in startup capital.Her current business plan is remarkably solid, I must admit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the numbers, the projections, seeing the dream my sister had likely been nurturing even while pretending to support my marriage,&#34;And?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Kane Ventures will be very interested in her proposal. So interested that I&#39;m sending my protégée,you... to handle the potential investment personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image formed in my mind instantly. Mle, transformed, powerful, wealthy beyond imagination sitting across from Rose, holding her dreams in my hands. Her not recognizing the sister she&#39;d betrayed, now positioned to grant or destroy her future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long?&#34; I asked. &#34;How long until I can face her as Camille Kane?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One year. Perhaps eighteen months. Time for your &#39;death&#39; to fade from memory. Time for your new identity to solidify. Time for you to master every skill you&#39;ll need to dismantle their world piece by piece.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, a plan forming. Not just revenge, but justice. Not just destruction, but reconstruction. Taking back everything they&#39;d stolen from me and more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria handed me a final document, a schedule that spanned months, detailing my transformation from Camille Lewis to Camille Kane. Language lessons. Etiquette training. Finance courses. Self-defense classes.Public speaking workshops. A complete rebuilding from the ground up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It begins tomorrow,&#34; she said. &#34;5 AM. Personal trainer. 7 AM. Hair and styling. 9 AM. Diction coach. 11 AM.Press conference preparation. 2 PM. Official introduction to the board of Kane Industries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day stretched before me, the first of many that would forge me into someone new. Someone stronger.Someone capable of executing the justice I deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria opened her desk drawer and withdrew a small velvet box. &#34;One last thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside was a pendant, a silver phoenix rising from flames, suspended on a platinum chain. Diamonds formed the bird&#39;s wings, catching light as she held it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My gift to you. A reminder of what you&#39;re becoming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved behind me, fastening the necklace around my throat. The pendant settled against my skin, cool at first, then warming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From the ashes of what they did to you,&#34; she murmured, her hands resting briefly on my shoulders. &#34;From the fire they thought would destroy you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I touched the phoenix, feeling its weight against my collarbone.&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria returned to her desk, gathering the files into neat stacks. &#34;Everything is in place. Your new identity,across from Rose, holding her dreams in my hands. Her not recognizing the sister she&#39;d betrayed, now positioned to grant or destroy her future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long?&#34; I asked. &#34;How long until I can face her as Camille Kane?&#34;</p>

                <p>I touched the phoenix, feeling its weight against my collarbone.&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria returned to her desk, gathering the files into neat stacks. &#34;Everything is in place. Your new identity,your education, your backstory. Now we need only set the pieces in motion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed another button on her phone. &#34;Send in the surveillance team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, three men entered the office. James, who I&#39;d seen earlier,and two others in similar dark suits.They carried tablets and folders, standing at attention until Victoria nodded for them to approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Updates,&#34; she commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Lewis and Mr. Rodriguez returned from Greece this morning,&#34; James reported, handing her his tablet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the parents?&#34; Victoria asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Lewises are maintaining appearances,&#34; another man reported. &#34;Charity functions, social obligations.Mrs.Lewis has increased her anxiety medication. Mr. Lewis has been spending more time at his club than at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Small cracks in their perfect facade. Just the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Financial status?&#34; Victoria directed this question to the third man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lewis Industries stock has dropped eight percent since the memorial service. Initial sympathy has faded,and investors are questioning Mr. Lewis&#39;s focus. The Rodriguez family business remains stable, though there are rumors of tension between Stefan and his father regarding the hasty relationship to Rose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria nodded, satisfied. &#34;Continue monitoring. I want updates daily. Focus particularly on Rose&#39;s business activities. Every investor she approaches, every meeting she takes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,Ms.Kane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They departed as silently as they&#39;d arrived, leaving me alone again with Victoria and the scattered remnants of my fabricated life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well?&#34; she asked, studying my reaction.Does this satisfy you? Knowing they&#39;re being watched? Knowing we see every move they make?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I considered the question, searching my feelings. The photos should have hurt. The news of them in Greece should have enraged me. Instead, I felt strangely detached, as if watching characters in a film I&#39;d already seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I answered honestly. &#34;It doesn&#39;t satisfy me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria raised an eyebrow.&#34;NO?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watching isn&#39;t enough. Knowledge isn&#39;t enough.&#34; I picked up the photo of Rose and Stefan on their vacation, her face glowing with triumph, his arm possessively around her waist. &#34;They&#39;re happy.They believe they&#39;ve won.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I set the photo down, turning it face-down on the desk. &#34;I don&#39;t want repoorts about their lives. I want control over their lives. I want them to build dreams I can shatter. Create hopes I can destroy. Construct a future l can dismantle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s smile spread slowly, pride evident in her eyes.nd you shall have that opportunity. But first,you must become someone they would never suspect. Someone they would trust with their aspirations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>l looked at the stack of documents that created Camille Kane, the foundation of my new existence. &#34;When do we begin dismantling their happiness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The moment you&#39;re ready,&#34; Victoria promised. &#34;The moment Camille Kane is real enough, solid enough to withstand their scrutiny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gathered the surveillance photos, sliding them into a folder. &#34;For now, focus on becoming. On shedding the last traces of the woman they hurt. On building the woman who will destroy them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, understanding the path before me. A long game. A patient revenge. Not the quick satisfaction.of confrontation, but the deeper pleasure of orchestrated downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow,&#34; I said, gathering my new identity papers. &#34;We begin tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing straighter, I faced Victoria with new determination.&#34;I&#39;m ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded once, satisfaction evident in her eyes. &#34;Then let us begin.&#34;</p>
