                <p>CAMILLE&#39;S POINT OF VIEW</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The parking garage of the hotel where i lodged was too quiet. My heels echoed against concrete, each click bouncing off empty cars and shadowed pillars.It was late, past midnight, but something felt wrong.Off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My confrontation with Rose and my family had left me drained, empty except for the cold satisfaction of finally seeing behind her mask. I fumbled with my key fob, wanting nothing more than to get to my hotel room and plan my next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A car door slammed somewhere in the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped, listening. Nothing but the hum of fluorescent lights and the distant sound of traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed in my purse. Rose&#39;s number.declined it, but not before noticing my signal had dropped to one bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Footsteps behind me. Multiple sets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked faster, cursing my choice of heels. The hotel&#39;s elevator wNas just around the corner, past a row of concrete pillars. If I could just...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Going somewhere, Mrs. Rodriguez?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man stepped out from behind a pillar. Tall,broad-shouldered, dressed in black. Professional. Two more appeared behind me, cutting off my retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a random attack, then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, it&#39;s Ms. Lewis now.&#34; My voice stayed steady despite my racing heart. &#34;And I have a dinner reservation, so if you&#39;ll excuse me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first man smiled. It wasn&#39;t a nice smile.&#34;I&#39;m afraid your plans have changed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped my purse tighter, feeling for the pepper spray I&#39;d started carrying after signing the divorce papers. &#34;Did my sister send you? Or was it Stefan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our employer prefers to remain anonymous.&#34; He stepped closer. &#34;Now, we can do this the easy way...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t let him finish. The pepper spray caught him directly in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He screamed, stumbling backward. I ran, kicking off my heels as I sprinted for the elevator. The other two men shouted, their footsteps thundering behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost there. Just a few more...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain exploded in my scalp as someone grabbed my hair, yanking me backward. My purse went flying,contents scattering across the concrete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That wasn&#39;t very nice.&#34; The first man&#39;s voice was rough with pain and rage. &#34;Hold her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strong hands gripped my arms. I fought, kicking,scratching, but they were too strong. Professional.Trained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our employer said you might be difficult.&#34; The first man wiped his streaming eyes. &#34;Said you needed to learn your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rose. This had Rose written all over it. Her parting shot, making sure I understood just how powerless really was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re going to kill me,&#34; I spat, &#34;at least have the guts to look me in the eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed. &#34;Kill you? No, no.Just a message.A reminder of what happens to people who don&#39;t know when to let go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first punch caught me in the stomach, driving the air from my lungs. I doubled over, gasping,but the men holding me kept me upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See, some people don&#39;t understand their role in life.&#34; Another blow, this one to my ribs. &#34;Some people need to be taught...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tasted blood. My vision blurred, pain shooting through my body. But I wouldn&#39;t cry. WNouldn&#39;t give Rose the satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice cut through the garage like a whip crack.Female.Authoritative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My attackers tensed. Through swollen eyes, I saw dark figures emerging from the shadows. Men in suits, moving with military precision. And behind them...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman. Tall, elegant, probably in her fifties but with an ageless quality about her. She wore a black designer suit that probably cost more than my car,her silver hair swept into a perfect chignon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was her eyes that caught me. Sharp, intelligent,and oddly...familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am,&#34; one of my attackers started, &#34;our employer...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is about to have a very bad day.&#34; The woman&#39;s voice was ice. &#34;Release her. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hands holding me disappeared. I slumped forward,pain shooting through my ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Secure them.&#34; The woman&#39;s command sent her men moving. My attackers didn&#39;t even try to run. They knew better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked toward me, heels clicking on concrete.Designer shoes. Probably cost more than my monthly rent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Camille Lewis.&#34; Not a question. She knew exactly who | was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to straighten, to maintain some dignity despite my split lip and torn dress. &#34;Do I know you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes softened, just slightly. Like she was seeing something, someone else in my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; She gestured, and more men appeared with a medical kit. &#34;But I knew someone very much like you,once. Someone who also had to learn the hard way about trust and betrayal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world was getting fuzzy around the edges. Blood dripped onto my ruined dress, each breath sending knives through my ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who...&#34; I swayed, darkness creeping in. &#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward, catching me as my knees buckled. This close, I could smell her perfume,something expensive, unique. Something that tickled at the edges of my memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone who&#39;s been watching you for a very long time, Camille.&#34; Her voice seemed to come from far away. &#34;Someone who&#39;s going to help you become everything they tried to prevent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The darkness was winning now. But before it took me completely, I heard her last words:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After all... you look just like my daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then nothing but black.</p>
