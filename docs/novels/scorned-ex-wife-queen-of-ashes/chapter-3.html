                <p>ROSE&#39;S POINT OF VIEW</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swirled the champagne in my crystal flute, watching the bubbles dance. Victory tasted sweet, just like I&#39;d imagined all these years. The living room of my penthouse apartment overlooked the city where I&#39;d spent twenty years pretending to be the perfect adopted daughter, the loving sister, the supportive friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To freedom,&#34; I whispered to my reflection in the window. The woman staring back at me smiled,perfect teeth, perfect hair, perfect lies. Just like always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed again. Another missed call from Stefan. He&#39;d been calling non-stop since Camille walked out, probably worried I&#39;d change my mind now that everything was in the open. Poor,predictable Stefan. Still thinking he was in control of any of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kicked off my Louboutins and sank into the leather couch, letting memories wash over me like warm wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first time I saw Camille Lewis, I hated her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was thirteen, fresh out of foster care, desperate to please my new parents. They&#39;d brought me to this massive house with its manicured lawn and marble floors, promising me a fresh start. A real family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then this skinny thing with braces and messy hair came bouncing down the stairs, all eagersmiles and innocent eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi! I&#39;m Camille. I&#39;ve always wanted a sister!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hugged me right there in the foyer, not caring that my clothes were secondhand or that I smelled like the group home&#39;s industrial detergent. Just pure,genuine joy at having a sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to vomit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because there she was, this awkward, imperfect girl who had everything I&#39;d spent thirteen years dreaming about. Parents who actually wanted her. A home she belonged in. A future secured by the Lewis family name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she didn&#39;t even appreciate it properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her over dinner that first night, watched how she slouched in her chair and talked with her mouth full. How she didn&#39;t know which fork to use for salad. How she laughed too loud and asked too many questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rose has such lovely manners,&#34; Mrs. Lewis...Mom.....had said, smiling at me. &#34;Perhaps you could learn from your new sister, Camille.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when I saw it. The first crack in Camille&#39;s perfect world. The slight dimming of her smile, the way she sat up straighter, tried harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed again, pulling me back to the present. Stefan&#39;s face lit up my screen, his fifth call in an hour. With a sigh, I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling, you&#39;re being needy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rose.&#34; His voice was rough. Had he been drinking?&#34;She&#39;s gone. Really gone. Blocked my number,cleaned out her closet...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that what we wanted?&#34; I kept my voice gentle,soothing. The same tone I&#39;d used all those times l&#39;d counseled Camille through her marital problems.Problems I&#39;d carefully orchestrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just... the way she looked at me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stefan, sweetheart.&#34; I let steel edge into my sweetness. &#34;Are you having second thoughts? After everything we&#39;ve been through?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! No, of course not. I love you. I&#39;ve always loved you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then stop calling me about your ex-wife. It&#39;s pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hung up, tossing the phone aside. Men were so predictably weak. Even Stefan, who l&#39;d spent four years grooming before pushing him toward Camille,still needed constant management.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he&#39;d served his purpose. Just like everyone else in my carefully constructed game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The family photo on my mantel caught my eye, my adoption day. I stood in the center, of course. Always the center. Camille pushed to the edge of the frame,trying so hard to smile through her insecurities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>God, it had been easy. Almost too easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little whisper here about how Camille was unstable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few concerned conversations with Mom about how worried I was about my dear sister&#39;s emotional state.Casual mentions to Dad about how Camille seemed to be struggling with basic adult responsibilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fourteen years of careful groundwork, positioning myself as the responsible daughter, the achievable dream, while slowly crushing Camille&#39;s confidence,her relationships, her sense of self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The college rejection was particularly inspired, if I do say so myself. All it took was one tearful conversation with Mom about finding Camille&#39;s &#34;secret&#34; diary filled with dark thoughts and destructive plans. Plans I&#39;d written myself, of course, in Camille&#39;s childish handwriting that I&#39;d spent months practicing to forge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, their precious younger daughter wasn&#39;t ready for college. Needed time to &#34;find herself.&#34;Needed to stay close to home where they could watch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where I could watch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took another sip of champagne, savoring the moment. Because this, this was what l&#39;d really wanted all along. Not Stefan, he was just a useful pawn. Not the Lewis fortune, though that would come in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,what I wanted was to watch perfect, precious Camille finally break. To see her realize that everything she thought she had family, love, security,had been built on my lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed with a text from Mom: &#34;Rose,darling, please come over. Your father and I need to talk about what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, already planning my performance. The tearful confusion, the reluctant confession about Stefan&#39;s pursuit, the gentle concern about Camille&#39;s mental state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I was done, they&#39;d be thanking me for protecting them from their unstable daughter all these years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up, I walked to my closet, selecting the perfect outfit for my next scene. Something subtle but expensive.GGrieving sister, not celebrating victor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The massive walk-in closet had been Camille&#39;s wedding gift to me. &#34;So you&#39;ll always have space for your amazing fashion sense,&#34; she&#39;d said, hugging me tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even then, even after years of watching me steal every spotlight, every opportunity, every scrap of parental approval, she&#39;d still loved me. Still trusted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled out a cream cashmere sweater, remembering how Camille used to borrow my clothes in high school. How I&#39;d wait until she had something important, a date, a presentation, an interview, then suddenly remember I needed that exact outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d always given them back without argument.Always apologized for the inconvenience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Always tried so hard to be the perfect sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My reflection caught my eye, and for a moment, just a moment, I saw something ugly there. Something that looked like the scared, angry foster kid who&#39;d walked into the Lewis house all those years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then I blinked, and I was perfect Rose again.Flawless Rose. Rose who could do no wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slipping on my Cartier bracelet, another gift from my dear sister, I prepared for my next performance. The concerned family meeting would need just the right touch of reluctant honesty, devastated betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Camille,&#34; I whispered to my reflection,practicing my worried frown. &#34;What have you done to yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as I turned to leave, something made me pause.That look in Camille&#39;s eyes before she&#39;d walked out I&#39;d never seen it before. Not in twenty years of pushing her, testing her, breaking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had looked almost like... understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like she&#39;d finally seen through my mask to the truth underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook off the uneasy feeling. Camille was weak, just like I&#39;d made her. She&#39;d run away, lick her wounds,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>maybe try to start over somewhere new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she&#39;d never be free of me. I&#39;d made sure of that years ago</p>
