                <p>Victoria stopped at a heavy wooden door, unlocking it with a key from her robe pocket. Inside was a home gym unlike any I&#39;d ever seen, state-of-the-art equipment, mirrors covering one wall, a boxing ring taking up the center of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flipped on lights that mimicked daylight, making me blink at the sudden brightness. Without a word,she crossed to a cabinet and extracted hand wraps and boxing gloves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put these on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took them, bewildered. &#34;Victoria, it&#39;s the middle of the night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;re awake, drowning in self-pity instead of planning your resurrection.&#34; Her voice wasn&#39;t cruel,just matter-of-fact. &#34;So put them on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands trembled as I wrapped them, clumsy from inexperience. Victoria watched, neither helping nor criticizing, until I managed to secure the gloves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hit that.&#34; She pointed to a heavy bag hanging in the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I approached it uncertainly. &#34;I&#39;ve never boxed before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not teaching you to box. I&#39;m teaching you to channel your rage.&#34; She positioned herself behind the bag, holding it steady. &#34;Now hit it. Hard as you can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling foolish, I threw a weak punch. The bag barely moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Again. Harder. Think of Rose&#39;s face when she saw you at the house that day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hit again, putting slightly more force behind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pathetic. Is that all the anger you have? After what she did to you?&#34; Victoria&#39;s voice hardened. &#34;Think of Stefan signing those divorce papers on your anniversary. Think of your mother comforting Rose while you walked away bleeding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat bloomed in my chest, anger flickering to life.I threw another punch, then another, each one harder than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better. Now think of them laughing in that restaurant. Toasting your destruction. Planning your replacement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image from my nightmare flashed before me,champagne glasses clinking, Rose wearing my ring,Stefan in the tie I&#39;d given him. Something snapped inside me. My next punch slammed into the bag with a force that surprised even me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; Victoria&#39;s approval fueled me. &#34;Again. Think of the men who attacked you. Think of your parents choosing Rose over you for fourteen years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lost myself in the rhythm of it, fists connecting with leather again and again. Each punch carried away a piece of hurt, of betrayal, of worthlessness. I hit until my arms burned and sweat soaked my nightgown,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>until tears mixed with perspiration on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hit until I had nothing left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally stopped, chest heaving, Victoria released the bag and handed me a towel without comment.I wiped my face, suddenly exhausted but oddly... cleaner somehow. Like I&#39;d purged something toxic from my system.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the last time,&#34; Victoria said, unwrapping the gloves from my hands. &#34;The last time you break for them. The last time you cry over people who never deserved your tears.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met her eyes, seeing not pity but recognition.Understanding. She knew this journey because she&#39;d walked it herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow, we begin.&#34; She checked her watch, a discreet Patek Philippe that probably cost more than a year&#39;s rent at my old apartment. &#34;In exactly four hours, you&#39;ll meet with the lawyers to finalize the adoption papers. By noon, you&#39;ll be legally Camille Kane. By evening, you&#39;ll have begun your education in finance, business strategy, and social warfare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tossed the gloves into a basket and turned to face me fully, silver hair gleaming under the lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tonight was necessary. Grief must be acknowledged before it can be transformed. But from sunrise onward, you are no longer their victim.You are my protégé. My heir.My daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#39;daughter&#39; hung in the air between us,weighted with expectations and possibilities. I straightened my shoulders, ignoring the protest from my ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if I&#39;m not strong enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s smile was sharp as a blade. &#34;Strength isn&#39;t something y/ou&#39;re born with. It&#39;s something you build,one painful brick at a time. And you, Camille, have been gathering bricks for years without knowing it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved toward the door, pausing with her hand on the light switch. &#34;Each betrayal, each disappointment, each moment they underestimated you - those are your building materials. Now we construct something magnificent from them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed her from the gym, back through silent hallways that would soon become familiar. My home.My fortress.My launching pad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At my bedroom door, Victoria paused. For a moment,I thought she might embrace me, offer some maternal comfort after the night&#39;s emotional storm.Instead, she simply touched my shoulder, a brief pressure that conveyed more than words could have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep if you can,&#34; she said. &#34;If not, start reading the files I left on your desk. The first details your sister&#39;s recent business ventures. She&#39;s seeking investors for a boutique clothing line, apparently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An investor. Rose, who&#39;d stolen my husband, my family, my dignity, was now seeking money. The irony was almost poetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long before she knows?&#34; | asked. &#34;That I&#39;m alive. That I&#39;m... yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria&#39;s smile held all the warm comfort of a circling shark. &#34;We&#39;ll wait until you&#39;re ready. Until you can look her in the eye and feel nothing but cold satisfaction. Until your hand doesn&#39;t shake when you sign the papers denying her funding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, something new settling into my bones.Something hard and certain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rest,&#34; Victoria said, turning away. &#34;Tomorrow is the first day of your new life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I entered my room, closing the door softly behind me. The nightmare&#39;s grip had faded, replaced by something sharper, clearer. Purpose. Direction. For the first time in years, perhaps ever, I knew exactly who I needed to become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the good sister. Not the perfect wife. Not the pleasing daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone new.Someone dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone who would make them all regret the day they decided Camille Lewis wasn&#39;t worth keeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone who would make them all regret the day they decided Camille Lewis wasn&#39;t worth keeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught my reflection in the window glass,disheveled, eyes red-rimmed, buIt standing straight.</p>
