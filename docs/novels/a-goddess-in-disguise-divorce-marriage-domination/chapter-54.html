                <p>Alexia still remnembered Waylon&#39;s last prank-it had left her utterly embarrassed and fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s lips curved into a faint smirk as he leaned in, gently tucking a loose strand of her hair behind her ear. His warm fingers grazed her cheek, slid past her ear, and slowly traveled downward,leaving Alexia flustered and completely thrown off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks turned visibly pink, and it wasn&#39;t long before she looked like she was about to blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, he pulled back, that teasing energy disappearing as he gave her an innocent look. &#34;Your hair was out of place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smacked his shoulder, her face burning with embarrassment. &#34;This is all your fault!&#34; she huffed,awkwardly squirming out from under him. &#34;You&#39;re seriously such a pain now, Waylon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But despite her scolding, Waylon looked completely unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexia walked off, he leaned casually against the doorframe, a teasing look in his eyes.&#34;Don&#39;t let the door hit you on the way out,&#34; he said, not even bothering to walk her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, she marched away, her thoughts made up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This guy was awful and definitely not someone worth getting close to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, right outside the courthouse, Alexia sat quietly on a bench in her bold red coat, catching more than a few glances from people passing by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was human nature-when someone looked that stunning, people couldn&#39;t help but look twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind wandered back to her wedding with Roger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day had been heavy with tension. Roger hadn&#39;t even wanted the wedding. She hadn&#39;t really understood what it meant to be married or even how she truly felt. Her so-called mother&#39;s words had nudged her along, and she had gone with it, thinking it was the right thing to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she&#39;d wanted was her family&#39;s approval, to feel loved. She thought marrying Roger would check all the boxes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she now realized that what she truly needed was something marriage could never give her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she was still lost in thought, Roger&#39;s chilly voice snapped her back. &#34;Here already, Alexia? In such a rush to get rid of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia looked up and saw him standing a few steps away, perfectly dressed, as aways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even have the energy to argue and replied coldly, &#34;Since you&#39;ve already figured everything out,let&#39;s just get the paperwork done. That way, we won&#39;t have to cross paths again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s expression turned darker at her sharp response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman in front of him-bold, stunning, completely unbothered-was nothing like the quiet, obedient girl he once had at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had become someone fierce, magnetic, and dangerously beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when a woman held that kind of powerful charm, it was the kind of attraction men couldn&#39;t help but chase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Roger had always looked down on her for being money-minded, he couldn&#39;t deny that if Alexia had shown him this real, unfiltered version of herself from the beginning, maybe things wouldn&#39;t have ended in divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As far as he was concerned, if it couldn&#39;t be Sirius, it didn&#39;t really matter who he married. Marilee just happened to be the most convenient option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For him, marriage was nothing more than a matter of picking the better one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without much emotion, Roger pulled out a document from his briefcase and handed it to her. &#34;Just sign this,and we won&#39;t have to cross paths ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia took the document, gave it a quick glance, then tossed it straight back at his face without hesitation.&#34;You&#39;re unbelievable, Roger! Absolutely shameless!&#34; she snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The document slapped against,his face with a loud smack, drawing curious stares from people nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The so-called agreement he handed her was basically asking her to walk away with nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia let out a cold laugh. &#34;You&#39;re the one who cheated, and now you&#39;re hiding behind a prenup to twist things your way? The original division of property was already unfair and now you want me to leave empty handed? What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger didn&#39;t even flinch. He picked the document up and said in a low, sarcastic tone, &#34;So you do care.1thought you were above all this by now. You&#39;ve got Waylon backing you, right? Your future&#39;s looking golden.Why stress over some leftover cash? Just sign, and you&#39;re free to run into your bright new tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s brows knit together. &#34;I don&#39;t care how bright my future might be-it doesn&#39;t excuse your betrayal.And you think I&#39;ll walk away empty-handed lie it&#39;s nothing? Roger, is this really all you&#39;ve got? Throwing this agreement in my face just to humiliate me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Roger had barely been present and their relationship had faded long ago, Alexia had still given her all to the Gibson family over the past two years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Gloria, her difficult mother-in-law, had enjoyed her meticulous care for two years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, expecting her to walk away with nothing? It was like spitting on every sacrifice she had made.</p>
