                <p>&#34;The Jenkins couple didn&#39;t stop there. They even arranged your marriage with Roger. Sure, the two families used to be friends, but that bond was broken a long time ago. The Jenkins family have since thrown their support behind other political camps. That marriage was never about unity. It was a scheme to push the Gibson family aside for good. The girl they chose for Zayne came from a family that openly opposes the Gibson family politically.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre let out a sigh, shaking his head. &#34;Honestly,Alexia,things would have been so different if Marilee had any real ambition. Without her meddlingin your marriage and ruining her name in high society, she would have stayed the perfect girl, living off your blood since she was little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every move the Jenkins family made seemed to clear the way for Marilee, guiding her toward a life most people could only dream about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the reason for all the snide remarks, cold shoulders, and constant belittling from the Jenkins family became painfully clear to Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Parents, after all, chart their children&#39;s futures with ruthless efficiency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she was never their real daughter. All they saw in her was a walking blood supply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their hearts had always been set on their true child.Whatever scraps of kindness they tossed her way felt more like charity than real affection. In their minds,giving a girl from nowhere the chance to climb higher was generosity itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter smile tugged at Alexia&#39;s lips as these truths sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now I understand why they discarded me at Marilee&#39;s birthday party. They&#39;d squeezed out every last drop of use, so tossing me aside was easy.&#34; She knocked back her drink in one motion, setting her glass down with a determined thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre&#39;s expression softened. &#34;You know, it&#39;s okay to cry if you need to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What reason do I have to cry?&#34; Alexia clung to the glass. &#34;I was foolish enough to believe that if I became someone else, I might finally matter to them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grew up trying to fix herself. Always second-guessing. Always wondering if she was falling short.And always believing that if she worked harder, they&#39;d finally see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She once convinced herself that excellence would be the key. Striving to come out on top in everything, she gathered trophies and certificates. None of it mattered.What she received in return was a wall of cold indifference, her efforts swallowed up in silence. Not once did she hear even the faintest praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One time, with hopeful eyes, she asked her mother,&#34;Mom, aren&#39;t you proud I got first place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother looked past her, voice as cold as her stare &#34;In this family, it&#39;s fine to be average.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Average.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word haunted her. So she forced herself into the background, learning to live quietly, her achievements dimmed. To everyone else, she was a prodigy who burned out far too soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about it now, the truth almost made her laugh. They were never going to let her stand out. If she ever shone too brightly, Marilee would only be cast further into the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since it was nothing but a lie from the beginning,l want no part of it now,&#34; she declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolute as ever, Andre replied, &#34;You&#39;re far too good for them. The Jenkins family will never understand what they gave up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years passed, and Alexia&#39;s efforts for the Jenkins family never went unnoticed by those around her. Her worth had always overshadowed Marilee&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That all changed once the truth surfaced-she had no intention of lifting another finger for the Jenkins family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from her seat, Alexia threw Andre a look.&#34;Contact Bart Begum. Call off the international acquisition with Jenkins Group, and make sure the Jenkins family is forced out of Northbay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre&#39;s eyes lit up, a grin breaking across his face.&#34;Consider it done!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both stepped into the main bar area, where a bold runway show was underway, music pounding through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A burst of drama erupted just as the last bar girl strutted out. Some brute reached for her lingerie strap,only for her to retaliate by snatching a wine bottle and smashing it over his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crash of glass echoed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The party mood vanished instantly as everyone saw the man collapse, blood staining his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within seconds, the girl was thrown to the floor by the man&#39;s companions, and the scene turned to chaos,arguments and shouts filling the air. Staff scrambled to bring order, rushing to fetch the manager</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s eyes locked on the woman sprawled on stage.curiosity flashing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her closely, Andre caught the shift in Alexia&#39;s expression and couldn&#39;t help but ask, &#34;You seem to recognize her. Is she a friend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without breaking her focus, Alexia answered, &#34;We&#39;re not friends, but she&#39;s not just anyone. If I&#39;m not mistaken, she&#39;s Dracfield Military Tech&#39;s chief engineer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dracfield Military Tech? That&#39;s the up-and-coming arms company fighting us for contracts. That&#39;s top-secret information. Where&#39;d you learn that? Don&#39;t tell me you two have some history?&#34; Andre&#39;s curiosity was piqued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered flatly, &#34;That&#39;s between me and her.&#34;With that, she stepped forward to get a better look at the woman&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing nearer, she noticed someone had draped a man&#39;s jacket over the woman&#39;s bare shoulders-and right next to her stood Elton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Elton spotted Alexia, a sly grin flickered as his gaze drifted from her to Andre. &#34;Well, isn&#39;t this an interesting little reunion?&#34;</p>
