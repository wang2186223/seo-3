            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s pulse quickened, her heart thumping in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched Waylon in the hush of the music room.the only sound the lazy stretch and occasional meow of the cat curled nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a few moments-and Waylon&#39;s mildly curious look-for her to collect herself and return to the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick shake of her head, she straightened up,trying to appear composed. &#34;All right, let&#39;s see what you can do with Chopin, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon went still, eyebrows raised in mock disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot him a mischievous grin. &#34;What&#39;s with that look? Don&#39;t think I&#39;m so easily impressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His calm didn&#39;t waver. &#34;I&#39;m game if you are. But are you sure you have the patience to listen to the whole set?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia retorted, &#34;Since when do you think I give up so easily?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before another word could pass, the housekéeper&#39;s head appeared in the doorway. &#34;Dinner&#39;s ready. Mr Mason, Miss Jenkins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia switched gears in a heartbeat. &#34;Actually, food first sounds good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s quiet laugh followed her out of the music room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated at the table, Alexia eyed her own plain,carefully portioned plate, then glanced longingly at the colorful,mouthwatering spread set before Waylon.Her voice dropped to a mutter, eyes narrowed with envy.&#34;Now that&#39;s just cruel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon kept his attention on his meal. &#34;I told you already-bland food&#39;s the rule if you want to heal properly. It&#39;s for your own good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still... this is punishment, not a meal.&#34; Alexia pouted,gaze fixed on the spicy shrimp nearby. That shrimp looked impossibly juicy, and she could almost taste it in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in her craving, Alexia&#39;s daydreams were shattered as the very piece she&#39;d been eyeing disappeared-Waylon had snatched it right off the platter. He met her wounded glare, popped the shrimp into his mouth without a hint of remorse, and then flashed her a teasing grin. &#34;Delicious, actually. Want a bite?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia nodded so fast, it was almost comical</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon teased, &#34;Guess you&#39;ll have to imagine how good it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia shot him a scowl. &#34;You planned this, didn&#39;t you?Had the housekeeper make all my favorites, filled the table with temptation, and then stuck me with this hospital food just to torture me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon pretended to consider it, then replied,&#34;I thought it might cheer you up. Even if you can&#39;t eat it,maybe the smell and sight will lift your spirits a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia huffed, barely able to contain her frustration.&#34;Waylon, you&#39;re impossible. You&#39;re definitely doing this just to mess with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was its own kind of torture-being forced to watch,unable to join in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon just blinked,all wide-eyed innocence, as if he hadn&#39;t the faintest clue what she meant. &#34;You&#39;ve got it all wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s hands curled into fists, trying to hide how much it got to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth said one thing, but his eyes told an entirely different story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No surprises there-he was absolutely wicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of mischief flickered in Alexia&#39;s eyes as a new plan formed. &#34;On second thought,&#34; she declared,voice bright. &#34;I want the full set-Chopin, Mozart,Tchaikovsky, the whole lot! We&#39;re pulling an all-nighter, and I&#39;ll be right here making sure you don&#39;t back out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon froze mid-bite, then slowly set his fork back down. &#34;That&#39;s a rather devious move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper watched their playful back-and-forth, her laughter hidden behind her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to win, Alexia launched into her late-night &#34;supervision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet fatigue from the day&#39;s chaos quickly caught up with her. Waylon, sly as ever, eased into a series of soothing lullabies, and before long, she&#39;d surrendered -fast asleep on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the last melody faded, Waylon turned to find her curled up, lost in dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crossed the room quietly, kneeling beside her to take in her peaceful expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soft,steady breaths lifted her chest; her lashes brushed faint shadows onto her cheeks. Reaching out,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he gently tucked a strand of hair away from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long nap, the cat stirred, stretching before springing onto the sofa it crept toward Alexia&#39;s outstretched hand, ready to curl up beside her, but before it could settle in. Waylon scooped the feline up and whisked it out of the room without a hint of apology</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning brought a new visitor. Korbin arrived to see Waylon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped inside and immediately paused, catching sight of a pair of almond-toned heels with bright red soles lined up perfectly by the door-an unexpected detail that caught him off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin stood in the entryway, momentarily stunned.Had Waylon finally ditched his bachelor ways and invited a woman home? The sight of those heels was proof enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word around town was that no one-aside from the staff-could set foot in this house unannounced. Even Cowan himself called ahead. Any woman allowed past the door had to be someone extraordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seems Waylon had company last night.&#34; Korbin nodded at the shoes. &#34;Come on,tell me-which lucky lady stayed over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While trimming her potted blooms, the housekeeper replied,&#34;You know her too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin sprawled across the sofa, legs crossed,looking completely at ease. &#34;I know many people. If I&#39;m expected to guess every possibility, it might take all day. But if I had to pick the most likely candidate...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts drifted to the charity gala, where Waylon had crowned Alexia in front of a crowd, sending whispers rippling through the room.</p>
