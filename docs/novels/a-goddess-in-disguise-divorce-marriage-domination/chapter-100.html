                <p>Today was the last day Alexia would be bringing Waylon glazed ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she packed the lunchbox, her face looked serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lot had happened over the past week. She had canceled on Waylon twice because of personal matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about it now, she realized it wasn&#39;t fair and didn&#39;t match her values of being honest and reliable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So today, feeling genuinely remorseful, she made the lunch with care, hoping to use this chance to apologize for how recklessly she&#39;d behaved the night before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what their relationship was or might turn into, that didn&#39;t justify her impulsiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrying her guilt, Alexia showed up at Waylon&#39;s office right around lunchtime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator doors opened, she ran right into Waylon in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His usual calmness somehow made her feel even more self-conscious. &#34;Hi, Waylon,&#34; she greeted, a bit stiffly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon arched a brow and let out a small chuckle,though it felt slightly forced. &#34;What brings you by without any warning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; just remembered I had to bring you the batch of glazed ribs today-the last time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The last time, huh? You make it sound like I won&#39;t be around to eat any more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia quickly waved her hand and gave a nervous laugh. &#34;No, no, don&#39;t say that! You&#39;ll get plenty more and live a long, healthy life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon, watching from nearby, couldn&#39;t help but frown.What was going on between the two now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon nodded politely. &#34;&#39;Thank you, but I won&#39;t be able to enjoy your ribs today. I&#39;ve got a two-hour meeting starting in ten minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s alright. I&#39;ll wait. I have something I need to talk to you about in person,&#34; Alexia replied, keeping her smile intact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon shot Simon a look, and Simon instantly understood. &#34;Ms. Jenkins, this way please. You can wait in the lounge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; Alexia said politely with a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked over to the sofa, sat down quietly, and waited patiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hour went by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And finally-four.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her calm and quiet patience slowly turned into full-blown frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A million wild thoughts flooded her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was Waylon still not back? Was he doing this on purpose?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he angry? Most likely!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smacked her forehead in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously? Had she actually believed he&#39;d return?She must&#39;ve been out of her mind. Of course he was playing with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon was clever. If he wanted to mess with someone, he could do it in his sleep. He must be mad, and this was payback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Waylon, you stingy jerk!&#34; she muttered under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just as her frustration hit its peak, the door finally opened and Waylon walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Alexia shot up from the couch in a panic, only to lose her balance and fall right back down with a thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning against the doorframe wwith his usual calm demeanor, Waylon raised a brow and smirked.&#34;Alexia, what were you calling me just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia quickly smoothed down her messy hair and acted as if nothing had happened. &#34;What? I didn&#39;t say anything. You must&#39;ve imagined it. Didn&#39;t you say the meeting would last two hours? | waited nearly four. Is this how a man of honesty and integrity behaves?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of getting flustered, Waylon remained cool and composed. &#34;There were some unexpected delays. But when exactly did I ever say I was honest and trustworthy? Do you have a time, place, or quote? Or was that just something you made up in your sleep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia was at a loss for words. His comebacks were way too sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She huffed, unable to hold it in any longer. &#34;Waylon, I honestly pity the girl who ends up dating you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, he shot back, &#34;Don&#39;t waste your sympathy on others. You&#39;d do better worrying about yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was guilt over what happened the night before, or maybe she just didn&#39;t have the energy to argue-either way, Alexia found herself unusually patient with Waylon today. &#34;I actually came to talk to you about something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s expression shifted slightly, his gaze focusing on her. &#34;Alright, I&#39;m listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she opened her mouth to speak, an unexpected sound cut her off-her stomach growled loud and clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s eyes instantly dropped to her flat stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mortified, Alexia slapped a hand over her face.If only she could sink into the floor right then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t eaten?&#34; Waylon asked, frowning. &#34;You seriously sat here for four hours without touching a thing? Are you insane?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wasn&#39;t hungry before,&#34; she muttered defensively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon walked over and took her wrist. &#34;Come on,let&#39;s go get food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I made glazed ribs,&#34; she mumbled, thinking it&#39;d be easier to just warm them in the microwave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon, as if he knew what she was thinking,looked over and said, &#34;Alexia, those are mine. I&#39;ll eat them tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia blinked, confused. &#34;But they&#39;re not even fresh anymore. Doesn&#39;t that bother you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon reached out and tapped her forehead gently with his knuckles. &#34;Have some faith in your cooking,will you? Whatever you make tastes good no matter when I eat it.&#34;</p>
