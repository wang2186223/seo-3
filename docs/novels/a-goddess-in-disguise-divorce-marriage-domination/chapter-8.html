            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Despite the chaos around her, Alexia didn&#39;t move an inch. She stayed perfectly composed, her fingers intertwined and her chin gently propped on them,watching Roger in silence, who was now soaked in cold sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t believe she&#39;d wasted her time on someone like him-shrinking herself, holding back,staying in a marriage that should&#39;ve never happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The club manager walked up, eyeing the mess around him. He didn&#39;t dare to intervene, so he turned to Alexia and pleaded, &#34;Ma&#39;am, could you help us out here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole thing had turned into a circus. Marilee was still yelling and crying, Roger looked in pain, and the crowd treated it like a live show, enjoying every second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia gave a small, cold smile, clearly unimpressed.Honestly, she was already bored. &#34;Andre, let him go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre snorted sarcastically but did what she said and Let go of Roger&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia stood up slowly, her tone steady and firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roger, I don&#39;t want your money. Just make sure you show up at the courthouse tomorrow to finalize the divorce. Don&#39;t make me wait. And if there&#39;s still a shred of decency in you, look after your grandmother.She&#39;s the only one in the Gibson family who ever gave a damn about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s whole body stiffened. He snapped his head up,clearly shocked.Alexia looked completely unbothered,but somehow, it felt like she actually pitied him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That hit him harder than he wanted to admit. What was that look supposed to mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who did she think she was, giving him that look? Like she could read him inside out? Like she felt sorry for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger started to lose it again, but before he could step forward, Marilee clung to his arm in panic. &#34;Roger,you need to go to the hospital! Stop paying attention to her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of me!&#34; Roger snapped, pushing her hand off.&#34;Alexia, don&#39;t you dare walk away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His angry voice followed her, but Alexia didn&#39;t even flinch. She glanced back just once, seeing Marilee clinging tightly to Roger&#39;s arm like a lifeline. That possessive hold-it was clear Marilee was terrified he might still chase after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Alexia found it hard to believe she had once fought so hard for this man. How could she have spent all those years trying to hold onto something that was never worth it in the first place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought nearly made her laugh. She shook her head and walked off without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger was no longer someone she&#39;d ever turn back for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre stayed close, matching her pace. A swarm of reporters and onlookers had gathered outside,clogging the entrance and flashing cameras in every direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But unlike the night before, Alexia was completely composed. Every step she took carried quiet strength -an aura that made people think twice before getting in her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing her change in demeanor, the reporters didn&#39;t dare swarm her this time. Instead, they turned their focus on Andre, throwing all their questions at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre took control of the scene with his usual charm.Smiling confidently, he fielded each question thrown his way without missing a beat. &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m just here for a little vacation. The views are stunning, the food&#39;s fantastic, and the people aren&#39;t bad either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with a nonchalant shrug, he continued, &#34;Of course, I&#39;ve known Alexia for quite some time.I happened to be in town when I heard about the divorce and figured it was as good a reason as any to toast to a fresh start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd laughed, but the questions kept coming-sharper and more eager now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roger Gibson? No, thanks. That guy&#39;s bad for the mood.&#34; Andre shook his index finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s my relationship with Alexia?&#34; He paused,smirking slightly. &#34;Take a guess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dramatic pause did the trick. Then, he delivered the line with a playful grin. &#34;I&#39;m pursuing her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That one sentence set the whole crowd off.Gasps filled the air as reporters scrambled to catch every word,rushing to publish the scoop of the day-&#34;World -Class Racer Confesses to Chasing After Former Jenkins Heiress!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, they made it into the car. Andre started the engine, while Alexia leaned back in her seat,amused. &#34;Thanks for the help, Andre. Your acting&#39;s getting pretty good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre gave her a look. &#34;Who said I was acting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on. You&#39;ve always had my back-that part&#39;s genuine.&#34; She let out a soft laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre let out a dramatic sigh. &#34;Knew you&#39;d say that.But never mind, let&#39;s move on. I&#39;ve got something to tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Alexia asked, curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s about your past.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed a bit, but Andre didn&#39;t stop.&#34;Right after the news dropped about Marilee being the real daughter, we started digging. Her mother has been wiring money every month to a woman, Ms. Carter.She is the wife of a rich businessman from Brookline and Marilee&#39;s adoptive mother. The payments started twenty-four years ago-the exact year you and Marilee were born. That means the Jenkins family already knew who their real daughter was-long before they brought you in. From everything we&#39;ve seen,the Jenkins family taking you in wasn&#39;t a mistake,but intentional-a conspiracy.&#34;</p>
