                <p>Once the soup was done, Waylon leaned over and lightly nudged Alexia&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Wake up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia slowly blinked her eyes open, still dazed from the alcohol. Her usually clear gaze was hazy. She took a small sip of the soup, then frowned in disgust.&#34;Oh my god, what is this? Did you boil gym socks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon, a bit offended, scratched his chin, looking slightly embarrassed. &#34;Is it seriously that bad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia pouted, setting the spoon down. &#34;You always test your questionable cooking on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon kept a deadpan expression. &#34;Clearly, it&#39;s the soup&#39;s fault. Not mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia pushed the bowl aside. The bitterness didn&#39;t help sober her up, it only made her more irritable.Annoyed with how disoriented she still felt, she abruptly tugged at Waylon&#39;s tie, pulling him down onto the sofa with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re really something,&#34; she muttered, tracing his face with her fingers like she was trying to memorize every line. &#34;You know what people say about me?That I snagged you with my looks. But have they seen you? Maybe you seduced me with that annoyingly perfect face of yours. Has anyone ever thought of that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon blinked, surprised by her boldness. Then a slow, dangerous smile crept onto his face. &#34;And here I thought you were shy,&#34; he murmured, leaning in until their foreheads almost touched. His voice dropped. &#34;How about a lesson then? You show me how you&#39;d like to be seduced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s thoughts were too foggy to come up with a clever comeback. She wasn&#39;t prepared for his voice to sound that seductive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting on impulse, she brought her hands to his jaw,tilted his face slightly, and pressed her lips to his without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon was caught off guard as her soft lips met his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kiss started clumsily, hesitant and brief, but Waylon quickly took over, turning it into something deeper, more purposeful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every movement of his lips was deliberate, stirring a growing heat between them, wrapping the room in tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia was breathless, her strength melting beneath the intensity of his kiss. Sensing the awkward angle,Waylon slipped his arms around her waist and effortlessly pulled her onto his lap. His lips wandered -from her mouth to her jawline, brushing over her cheeks and settling behind her ear, before trailing sensually down her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia couldn&#39;t resist him. His touch, his breath-they felt addictive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body reacted in a way she didn&#39;t understand,craving more. It wasn&#39;t just about the kisses anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found herself wanting something deeper,something she&#39;d never felt with anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every caress, her desire deepened, going beyond mere physical contact. As the buttons of his shirt came undone, Waylon paused, his breath catching in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she looked up at him-glassy eyes, swollen lips-was enough to shatter any shred of control he had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, a flash of logic cut through the haze.He remembered that she didn&#39;t hold her alcohol well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they crossed the line now, she might not even remember it. Worse, she could wake up and shrug it off with a vague &#34;I was drunk.&#34; He didn&#39;t want that,not with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that in mind, he leaned down and bit her lower lip, just hard enough to sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The metallic tang of blood touched his tongue,and Alexia suddenly blinked, startled back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heat in Waylon&#39;s eyes hadn&#39;t disappeared. He reached out, brushing his fingers lightly across her flushed lips, his voice low and rough. &#34;Do you really think I&#39;m that easy to win over, Alexia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had his pride. When it came to her, he couldn&#39;t settle for anything less than sincere love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she didn&#39;t respond and just stared at him,dazed and unsure, Waylon let go of her and adjusted the collar she had tugged out of place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want me, then give me your heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, he turned and walked out,closing the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia sat there, confused and overwhelmed. She tried to figure out what he meant, but before she could make sense of anything, sleep took over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, her internal clock did its job and woke her on time, though her head felt like it had been run over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still half-asleep, she slowly made her way to the bathroom to freshen up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stood in front of the mirror, something caught her eye-the faint bite mark on her lips and the reddish patches trailing down her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze, staring blankly for a few seconds before the memories of the last night came rushing back in fragments. The kisses. The touches. Waylon&#39;s breath on her skin. Her cheeks turned bright red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia groaned softly and raked a hand through her hair, feeling a mix of regret and embarrassment flooding in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth had gotten into her last night? She actually flirted with Waylon like that? So boldly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the worst part wasn&#39;t her own boldness-it was that he had walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes,he left. In the middle of all that! Why? Did he not want her? Or was she just not irresistible enough?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia had a history of forgetting things when she drank too much, and beyond the kissing, everything Waylon had said was a blur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at her reflection, Alexia puffed her cheeks,then nodded with mock confidence. &#34;Still pretty.Clearly, the problem&#39;s not me. Waylon&#39;s just got questionable taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even as she joked to herself, a new anxiety started creeping in. After everything that happened last night, how was she supposed to face him again?</p>
