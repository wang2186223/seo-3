                <p>With a light laugh, Alexia replied, &#34;Honestly, there&#39;s nothing behind it. I just think Bella&#39;s really stunning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in Bella&#39;s gaze caught Elton&#39;s attention as she looked at Alexia, her eyes bright. He pressed his lips together,reached for the business card, and gave it a once-over. Surprise flashed across his face.&#34;You&#39;ve started working as a professor at Afoross University?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. You&#39;re always welcome to sit in on a class,you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not missing a beat, Elton shook his head. &#34;That won&#39;t be happening. Academic lectures put me to sleep.And honestly, I&#39;d rather keep my distance. Waylon would have my head if he found out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of playful challenge sparked in Alexia&#39;s eyes.&#34;You say that, but there was a time when you and !were thick as thieves, Beauty Elton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia, stop calling me that, I mean it!&#34;Elton snapped,clearly recalling some unpleasant memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m only telling the truth! Back then, you were the best-looking boy in the neighborhood,&#34; Alexia said,pretending to be innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration crept across Elton&#39;s face as he remembered how playful Alexia could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just wait. I won&#39;t forget this,&#34; he grumbled, cutting the exchange short and marching Bella out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Vinson stood outside, taking in the whole encounter. He watched as Elton helped Bella into a waiting car before climbing into his own and turning the key.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside his car, Elton still simmered with frustration.He pulled out his phone and fired off a message to Waylon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia was teasing me again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few moments later, a short reply lit up his screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Handle it yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elton stared at the message, letting out a humorless laugh. &#34;You let her get away with too much,&#34; he muttered to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jenkins Group headquarters stood bright against the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the wide glass windows, the CEO&#39;s office glowed.Zayne slumped in his chair after a marathon of meetings, kneading his temples and wishing for a break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp knock interrupted his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary rushed inside, a stack of documents gripped in her arms and concern written all over her face. &#34;Mr. Jenkins, urgent news from Northbay. Bart Begum just backed out of our multinational acquisition deal. Goldrose Consortium has withdrawn their investment from Jenkins Group. And the Wooddale factory is now facing forced closure next month!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the news landed, Zayne snapped upright.His eyes widened. &#34;What did you just say? That acquisition went through just last month. We haven&#39;t even reached the second week since then. Why would Bart abruptly pull the plug and toss aside all cooperation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s face showed her confusion and alarm.&#34;We&#39;ve tried to gather some clues quietly, but Goldrose Consortium won&#39;t say a word. They&#39;re keeping everything under wraps!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation boiling within him, Zayne wasted no time and placed an international call. When the line picked up,he pushed his temper aside, aiming to resolve things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Zayne Jenkins. Put me through to Mr. Bart Begum. What? He&#39;s asleep? At two in the afternoon?You want to speak instead? Can you really explain what&#39;s going on? This partnership means everything to Jenkins Group. We&#39;ve bent over backward to show goodwill, and now Goldrose Consortium is bailing halfway through. Even a company with your reputation can&#39;t just walk away from a commitment like this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary observed the tense exchange,staying quiet and not daring to interrupt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few moments passed before laughter crackled through the receiver, cold and mocking, slicing through the heavy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Jenkins, we see why you&#39;re upset, but frankly, we never considered Jenkins Group an equal partner. We hold the power here, and our decisions are final.You never had any real leverage in this deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zayne&#39;s humiliation boiled over. He slammed his fist onto the desk, the sharp crack making his secretary flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through clenched teeth, he spat, &#34;You have no shame at all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, the other party replied, &#34;By the way, Mr.Begum wanted you to know. While the Jenkins family&#39;s luck has run out, the real trouble is just  beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That last line hit Zayne like a slap. His skin prickled as dread washed over him. He fumbled for a response,but the call ended without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reeling from the insult, he lashed out-one furious swipe sent a priceless vase tumbling, shattering into pieces on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound echoed in the office, as sharp and final as the blow to his pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cradling his head in his hands, Zayne slumped in his chair,pain pounding behind his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one knew the truth better than he did-Jenkins Group looked strong on the outside, but inside, every step forward felt like quicksand.</p>
