                <p>Simon gave a quick nod but lingered in the doorway,looking uncertain about leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something else on your mind?&#34; Waylon asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon steadied himself with a slow inhale. &#34;This evening makes it the third time your grandfather has asked you to come back for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cool, almost mocking laugh slipped from Waylon when he heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s posture grew stiff. He stayed rooted to the spot. A silence lingered between them until, at last,Waylon&#39;s steady voice broke through. &#34;Just ignore him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood, Mr.Mason!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s answer rang out, and he left the room with respect, though the feeling of uneasiness trailed after him like a stubborn echo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back inside, the cat had grown tired of all the attention and wriggled in Waylon&#39;s hold, hoping for freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon didn&#39;t let it go so easily, and the creature responded by swatting at his hand. Only then did the cat use its nimble legs to leap out of his arms,landing with grace and pride before marching back to its own corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witnessing such boldness from the cat, Waylon was reminded of Alexia, feeling both frustrated and amused. &#34;You really do have a temper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Ada had just dropped Alexia at the hotel.She eyed the place with clear displeasure.&#34;Are you seriously planning to stay here? Come on, you could stay in one of my apartments.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia shook her head. &#34;Thanks, but I&#39;m not struggling for a place. The hotel is just for now. I was weighing my options, and now that I&#39;m set on joining Afoross University, I&#39;ll be moving over to Newhall</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of Newhall Garden worked some of the tension out of Ada&#39;s face. &#34;So, how much did Roger actually hand over after the divorce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia simply lifted a finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada&#39;s brows knitted together. &#34;You got a hundred million?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia let out a dry laugh. &#34;With two properties way out by the city limits, the total is barely ten million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada cursed under her breath, &#34;That&#39;s pathetic! Isn&#39;t he afraid of being laughed at? Is this all the heir of the Gibson family can offer? He&#39;s so cheap! That Newhall Garden place didn&#39;t come from him, did it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia replied, &#34;No, I bought it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada let out a breath of exasperation. &#34;You let him off too easy. If I were you, I&#39;d drag Roger to court for a proper split. The Gibsons are rolling in money!Letting Roger walk away like this is a gift he doesn&#39;t deserve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of amusement crossed Alexia&#39;s lips as she thought back. &#34;Roger had me sign a prenuptial agreement before we ever got married. Honestly,I thought it was all pretty ridiculous at the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Money had never been a concern for her, so she never cared much for Roger&#39;s fortune. She could only laugh at his habit of being so careful with money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada&#39;s outrage spilled over. &#34;He&#39;s unbelievably small-minded! Trying to cling to every coin he has! Alexia,why didn&#39;t you stand your ground and secure more for yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Alexia just stared ahead before replying, &#34;Maybe everyone was right about me.Maybe I was out of mny mind. After all those years-Roger, the Jenkins family-I let myself fade into the background. It&#39;s almost funny, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sympathy flickered in Ada&#39;s eyes. &#34;Don&#39;t talk like that. Those days are behind you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new resolve showed in Alexia&#39;s expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. It&#39;s finished. So, Ada, you don&#39;t need to worry. Whatever Roger kept from me in the settlement, I&#39;ll find a way to get it back somewhere else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With time, she had come to know every corner of the Gibson empire, its tangled shares, its hidden cracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Missing out on Roger&#39;s assets meant little. The way their family business was structured, Roger&#39;s grip wasn&#39;t as tight as he liked to think. Real triumph would be claiming a piece straight from Gibson Group itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Ada at those words. &#34;As long as you have a plan of your own, I&#39;m happy. Once you get settled in your new place, ring me up. We&#39;ll celebrate.Deal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexia nodded in agreement, Ada pressed the pedal and sped away in style.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the hotel, Alexia was just in time to catch sight of Travis Jenkins coming out, his arm looped around a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met, and aflicker of surprise passed over Travis&#39; face. Noticing his sudden tension, the woman at his side cast Alexia a curious glance, her unease quickly rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not hiding her suspicion, the woman tossed a hostile glare at Alexia. She leaned in close to Travis and whispered, &#34;Do you know her? Is this someone you&#39;ve been keeping from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Alexia&#39;s cold stare sliced through her, sending the woman shrinking closer to Travis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word of denial or comfort, Travis continued to stare at Alexia, his gaze heavy with meaning. &#34;So you&#39;re not even going to say hello?&#34;</p>
