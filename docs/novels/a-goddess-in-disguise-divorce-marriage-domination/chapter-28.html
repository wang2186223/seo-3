                <p>Waylon&#39;s words sent a flutter through Alexia&#39;s chest,prompting her to glance his way and meet his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met for a fleeting moment, and she quickly turned away, hoping no one would notice the flicker of nerves on her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon reaching a private lounge, Alexia settled into her seat and took in the arrangement around her.Never before had she witnessed so many heirs from distinguished families gathered in one place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pair of subtle nods from Elton and Korbin greeted her arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every person here carried the poise of old money,their watchful eyes quick to size up the room. It didn&#39;t take long for them to realize Alexia wasn&#39;t a stranger to influence, especially with her easy rapport with the heirs of the most powerful families.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sense of occasion, Elton lifted his glass in her direction. &#34;It&#39;s good to see you back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no mistaking the significance behind his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glances full of recognition flickered around the room,and soon, everyone was joining Elton, lifting their glasses high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room buzzed with genuine excitement, the greeting ringing out for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a reception left Alexia more than a little overwhelmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon, on the other hand, stayed poised and unbothered, deftly guiding the energy in the room.&#34;Just juice for her this evening,&#34; he said smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That set off a ripple of friendly laughter and a round of winks among the guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like Waylon is keeping a close watch,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>someone teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia just smiled, taking the good-natured teasing in stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let Alexia relax and have her fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If juice is her drink of choice, that works for us. She can keep the mood, and we&#39;ll handle the liquor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the others sip their drinks, Alexia felt a wave of awkwardness wash over her. Under the scrutiny of Waylon&#39;s steady gaze, she picked up a glass of mild fruit wine and polished it off in one motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; Alexia might have been proud, but she knew when to show respect. Good manners were never something she forgot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon wasted no time sliding her glass away.&#34;That&#39;s enough for tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small frown formed on Alexia&#39;s lips.&#34;You know,I can handle my drinks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s lips curled in amusement, as if her claim was pure entertainment. &#34;Is that so? Must be the same confidence people get when they&#39;re already tipsy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d witnessed her inebriated before, and those episodes had been nothing short of a trial for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one brow arched, Alexia asked him, &#34;And what makes you think you know me so well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just say I&#39;ve handled my share of some intoxicated troublemaker,&#34; Waylon replied, voice cool as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity flickered in her eyes, but before Alexia could press further, several senior gentlemen approached in sharp suits. Waylon stood to greet them, exchanged a few formalities, then turned to Alexia. She nodded. &#34;Go on. I&#39;ll be just fine here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Waylon mingling, the lounge kept its cheerful buzz. No one brought up the Gibson family,each guest careful to keep things smooth for Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Waylon&#39;s name popped up, Elton and Korbin made sure to keep the mood light, careful never to make her uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a handful of lighthearted games, Alexia slipped away for a breath of air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found herself wandering into a quiet corridor,only to unexpectedly encounter Marilee, dressed in an elaborate embroidered gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they brushed past each other, Alexia didn&#39;t so much as break stride, acting as though Marilee were invisible-until a firm voice stopped her in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee gave Alexia a slow, appraising look before breaking into a tight smile. &#34;You&#39;ve certainly found your way up the social ladder. I never pictured you clinging to Waylon&#39;s side. You must feel on top of the world making such a scene tonight, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a flicker of emotion crossed Alexia&#39;s face. &#34;It is pretty satisfying, actually. Why do you care?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That blunt response brought a flash of anger to Marilee&#39;s eyes. &#34;Enough with the act. Ever since you were tossed from the Jenkins family and dumped by Roger, you&#39;ve been bitter. You couldn&#39;t stand losing your old life, so you threw yourself at Waylon. All this just for a littleattention and to prove you&#39;ve still got backing,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia quirked a brow. &#34;Sounds like you&#39;re jealous. Is that it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her casual jab, delivered with cold precision, nearly sent Marilee over the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy burned, no question about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Marilee wasn&#39;t the only one. Alexia had become the object of envy for half the women in the banquet,all because she stood beside Waylon, bathed in admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That realization made Marilee&#39;s sneer deepen.&#34;Don&#39;t let this go to your head, Alexia. Men like Waylon have women lined up for miles. It&#39;s only a matter of time before he gets bored. When he does, I can&#39;t wait to see you brought down a peg.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any patience Alexia had was gone. &#34;Well, you&#39;ll just have to wait and see for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cool dismissal left Marilee momentarily speechless, stung by the indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did Alexia always act so untouchable?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What made Marilee so unworthy of even being considered her rival?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seethed. How could a woman who&#39;d been cast aside, who lost everything to her, still carry herself with such confidence?</p>
