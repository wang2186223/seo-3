                <p>Eighteen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image of Nolan, also eighteen and buried in textbooks, flashed through Alexia&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to the boy beside her and asked,&#34;Shouldn&#39;t you be in school? Is this some kind of after-school gig?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rubbed the back of his neck, a little sheepish. &#34;I&#39;m not in school anymore. And don&#39;t worry. Even if I&#39;m young, I know what I&#39;m doing. I&#39;m just as good as the older ones, maybe better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other men froze for a moment, shooting him looks full of contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still shaken, Alexia glanced over at Sylvia and called her out. &#34;You&#39;re a lawyer, Sylvia! Don&#39;t you feel the least bit ashamed hiring someone so young?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia, who was casually leaning into the man next to her, responded with a grin, &#34;He said he&#39;s a pro, didn&#39;t he? He&#39;s just earning his way. You need to stop that savior complex of yours. You spentyears cleaning up the Jenkins and Gibson families&#39; mess like it was your job. It drained you. Now that you&#39;re finally free,why not startliving for yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada chimed in, &#34;Right? Sylvia&#39;s got a point. Women who overthink everything just end up tired and heartbroken. Look around-these guys are eye candy! Let yourself breathe a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia didn&#39;t bother protesting. She reminded herself that this night was about unwinding. So, she waved at a few of the guys, told them to bring her drinks and help her relax, but strictly no getting too close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia sighed,catching on to Alexia&#39;s guarded vibe.After a few rounds of drinks, she suddenly clapped her hands. &#34;Let&#39;s spice things up with a card game!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The game was a bold one-the person who drew the King card could command anyone to do anything. It was flirty, wild, and perfect for this kind of party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The game began, and Ada pulled the King card first.She dared Sylvia to give a cheek kiss to a guy present. But Sylvia, never one to hold back, grabbed the guy beside her and gave him a long,fiery kiss that lasted nearly a minute. Alexia stared, wide-eyed,nearly getting up to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia reached out and pulled her back down.&#34;Alexia, come on, why so shy? Look-money,affection, and physical needs don&#39;t have to come from the same man. Just split it up and enjoy life.Why burden yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia admired her boldness but sighed. &#34;I don&#39;t think I can do that, though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia raised a brow. &#34;Why not? Don&#39;t tell me none of them are your type.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia gave a half-laugh, avoiding the question by staying quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia squinted, sensing something was off. She turned to Ada and whispered, &#34;She&#39;s been married.How is she still so shy? Is she saving herself for  Ada paused, scratching her head. &#34;Oh right, didn&#39;t you hear? There were rumors that Alexia and Waylon were pretty close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia&#39;s eyes went wide. &#34;Wait, Waylon? Why was I the last to know something this juicy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice climbed too high, prompting Ada to quickly nudge her and whisper, &#34;Keep it down, will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia blinked, regaining her composure, then leaned in with a curious smile. &#34;So, what&#39;s the story there?Waylon,huh? Alexia&#39;s really something!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada shrugged. &#34;Honestly, I don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia&#39;s lips lifted into a sly smile. A playful idea sparked in her mind, and without much thought, she took a quick photo of Alexia with the men around her.Leaning closer to Ada, she whispered, &#34;Do you and Waylon follow each other on Facebook?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada nodded in confusion. &#34;Yeah.Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia sent the photo over, still grinning slyly. &#34;You know exactly what to do with this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada caught on instantly but looked hesitant. &#34;Won&#39;t it come off too obvious if I post it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an easy smirk, Sylvia crossed her arms. &#34;It&#39;s just a casual get-together. Acouple of group photos,post them like we&#39;re having a blast, and it&#39;Il all come off effortlessly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone turned playful. &#34;If he has feelings for her,this will definitely shake him up tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada shook her head, half-laughing. &#34;You&#39;re terrible,Sylvia!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sylvia&#39;s smile slowly vanished, her voice growing serious. &#34;If this doesn&#39;t bother him at all, then he&#39;s not worthy of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada immediately agreed. &#34;You&#39;re absolutely right!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting time, she got to work-picked the best photos, added a playful filter, and uploaded them to her social media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her caption read, &#34;It&#39;s been ages since | dropped by Star Club. Tonight&#39;s boys? Total eye candy. Who wants to go home when it&#39;s this fun?&#34; Just to stir the pot a little more, she made sure to tag both Alexia and Sylvia at the end.</p>
