                <p>Alexia didn&#39;t give Gloria a chance for another word.She ended the call with a quick tap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A satisfied hum escaped her as she headed for the shower,feeling victorious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she finished, she reached for her towel and began drying her hair. That was when her phone buzzed insistently on the bedside table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for it, noticing a notification on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A message popped up from Monica Wallace at AMOS Gallery. &#34;Sirius? Please, get back to me! It&#39;s urgent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia replied in confusion, &#34;What&#39;s the emergency?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank goodness you finally responded! The Chamber of Commerce just reached out to us.They&#39;ve sent an invitation especially for you. They want Sirius-the genius painter-to attend their banquet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia answered, &#34;You know I never show my face as Sirius. Sirius only exists for the art, nothing else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their relationship had always been straightforward and businesslike. She sent her paintings, signed the contracts, collected payments, and accepted the occasional trophy. Nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about this request set off an alarm in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly asked, &#34;You didn&#39;t say yes, did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Monica replied right away, &#34;Absolutely not! I know where you stand, but it&#39;s the Chamber of Commerce.Turning them down isn&#39;t so simple. That&#39;s why l thought-maybe we could submit one of your paintings for their charity auction. Showing your work is almost like you being there yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Monica&#39;s meaning was obvious-a donation would help smooth things over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding grudges wasn&#39;t Alexia&#39;s style. Even AMOS Gallery had to bow to the Chamber of Commerce.And with charity as the purpose, she saw no reason to refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she replied, &#34;That&#39;s fine with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief poured out of Monica in the next message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>AMOS Gallery treated Sirius like their prized possession. Back when the gallery was staring bankruptcy in the face, a mysterious fourteen-year-old girl-Sirius-sent in her very first painting. That single artwork rescued the gallery from collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without Sirius, AMOS Gallery would have faded into obscurity long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time flew, and before Alexia knew it, the banquet held by the Chamber of Commerce had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia intended to choose her own outfit, but Waylon had other plans, sweeping her away to an exclusive boutique filled with vintage gowns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounded by a row of stylists beaming at her, she felt a hint of nerves flutter in her chest-a feeling she rarely experienced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike the stylists, Waylon went straight to the point.Reaching for a sleek black feather gown, he offered her a gentle smile. &#34;This one stands out to me.Would you mind wearing it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His unexpected warmth caught Alexia off guard.Waylon had indeed changed. There was a new ease in the way he smiled now. When making requests, his smile was flawless, making it nearly impossible to refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right,&#34; Alexia answered, and with that, she took the gown and disappeared into the fitting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the final touch of makeup was applied, she stepped out, and every conversation in the boutique died on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s taste never missed the mark. The strapless black gown hugged her frame perfectly, turning her into something like a regal black swan-sophisticated and utterly mesmerizing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gown hugged her figure in all the right places,while the skirt floated with her everymove.Feathers and diamonds glinted under the lights, lending her a regal, almost otherworldly air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To finish the look, the stylists swept her hair into a polished style, letting a few strands trail along her neck. The effect was hypnotic. Artistry met glamour,leaving her looking like a living masterpiece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exclamations of admiration burst from the stylists and designers. &#34;Unbelievable! You&#39;re stunning! That dress could have been made for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Jenkins, may I get your contact details? I&#39;d love to collaborate with you in the future!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Ms. Jenkins, I&#39;m in the photography business. My company&#39;s publications are well-known.Would you consider giving me your number?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by all the attention, Alexia glanced in Waylon&#39;s direction, hoping for a lifeline, but he simply watched,thoroughly entertained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no other option, she finally asked, &#34;How do l look?&#34;</p>
