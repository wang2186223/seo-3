                <p>When Alexia still hadn&#39;t shown up, Serena stopped waiting and hurried to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short while later, Alexia walked out holdng Ginger in her arms, stroking its fur. &#34;You little rascal,hiding under the bed and making me look all over for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she entered the living room, she was surprised to find Serena busy in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena turned her head with an awkward smile. &#34;I smelled something burning while you were gone. When I lifted the lid, the stew looked a little charred, so I thought I&#39;d try to fix it before it got worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding what had happened, Alexia smiled gratefully. &#34;Thank you, really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ginger jumped down from her arms and wandered over to Betsey, who immediately began petting and playing with it happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexia stepped into the kitchen, she noticed Serena had already cut away the burnt sections of the ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks again,&#34; she said warmly. &#34;If you&#39;re not in a rush, why don&#39;t you stay for dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena paused for a moment. &#34;Are you sure? I wouldn&#39;t want to impose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s tone was light and welcoming. &#34;Absolutely! We&#39;re neighbors, aren&#39;t we? I ended up making way too much food tonight-no point letting it go to waste. And besides, I really like having Betsey around. Betsey,do you want to stay and have dinner with me tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsey&#39;s eyes sparkled with excitement. &#34;Really? We can?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course!&#34; Alexia grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Betsey so happy, Serena couldn&#39;t say no. &#34;Thank you for inviting us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the food finished cooking, a delicious aroma filled the entire space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s cooking was exceptional, and even Serena, who rarely ate much, found herself reaching for seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsey,meanwhile, was completely focused on her plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Jenkins, you&#39;re seriously talented in the kitchen. Did you learn to cook on your own?&#34; Serena asked earnestly. &#34;These ribs are honestly the best I&#39;ve ever tasted. Do you have a secret recipe or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia smiled and replied, &#34;Of course. If you enjoyed them that much, I&#39;ll gladly share the recipe with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena&#39;s eyes lit up, and she looked at Alexia with open admiration. &#34;That would be amazing. Oh,and I heard you teach at Afoross University? Under Prof. Ellis, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia nodded. &#34;Yes, I did.Do you know him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena nodded with familiarity.&#34;Cosmo Biotech has been working with Afoross University quite a bit recently. Prof. Ellis&#39;s lab has played a major role in developing one of our company&#39;s newest projects. He&#39;s someone I deeply respect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia smiled. &#34;He mentioned that Cosmo Biotech&#39;s newest product might be a game changer in the medical field. Congratulations in advance, Ms. Adams.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to her surprise, Serena&#39;s expression dimmed. The excitement Alexia had expected didn&#39;t come. &#34;It&#39;s still too early for congratulations. Right now, I just hope Cosmo Biotech survives long enough to even see the summit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia caught the change in tone and tilted her head, slightly puzzled. &#34;Wait, is something wrong with Cosmo Biotech?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena gave a faint, bitter smile as she began explaining how an unknown force had been targeting Cosmo Biotech through the stock market.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That foreign short-selling force already crushed several biopharma firms overseas, and now it&#39;s our turn.We&#39;ve tried to build up a defense bybringing in outside help, but honestly, it&#39;s an uphill battle.&#34; Serena exhaled. &#34;Cosmo Biotech just doesn&#39;t have the clout to get backing from any real heavyweights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia seemed to read between the lines. &#34;So you&#39;re banking on the summit, right? With all that international capital and attention, you&#39;re hoping to showcase the new product and attract a powerful backer to pul Cosmo Biotech out of this crisis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena admitted, &#34;it&#39;s the most realistic shot we have. Every company that&#39;s been hit by this short-selling group ended up bankrupt. If wetry to handle this alone, we won&#39;t make it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia suddenly saw Serena in a new light-she hadn&#39;t expected her to be this daring or ambitious. &#34;But have you thought about what happens if this doesn&#39;t work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved her fork in a circle, then cut through it as if making a point. &#34;That summit next month? It&#39;s not just a business meet-up. It&#39;s a power game between top political and corporate players. Whether it&#39;s Afoross or Dorbarrow, they already hold all the cards. Their networks are deep-rooted, and they play by their own rules. You think Cosmo Biotech can bounce back with one new product and suddenly draw in big investors and influential allies. But all that-your product, your data, your pitch-that&#39;s just your ticket to enter the room. The real battle starts after that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena looked at her, slightly stunned by the clarity of her words. &#34;I didn&#39;t expect you to understand financial politics so wwell.&#34;</p>
