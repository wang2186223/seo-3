                <p>Around noon the following day, Alexia wrapped up her lecture and stepped out of the building,heading toward her car in the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she neared the basketball court, a troubling scene drew her attention-Brandon was pestering a young woman nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the court&#39;s edge, Brandon&#39;s jersey clung to him with sweat. With an oily grin, he reached for the girl&#39;s arm,oozing smug confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl recoiled at once, her words breaking with tears. &#34;Keep your hands off me! I&#39;m not leaving with you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation flashed across Brandon&#39;s face. &#34;Tillie, do you understand what you&#39;re risking by saying no to me?The Gibson family doesn&#39;t even have to try to make someone like you disappear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand shot out again, aiming for Tillie Sanderson&#39;s wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A swift hand yanked Tillie out of reach, followed by a sharp slap to the back of Brandon&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon flinched at the sting,spun around, and found Alexia standing behind Tillie, fierce and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crossing her arms, Alexia fixed him with a glare that could slice through steel. &#34;Brandon, what gives you the right to corner a girl on campus?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon faltered for just a heartbeat under her stare, but indignation quickly took over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it with you, Alexia? Why do you always butt in? Can&#39;t you keep out of things that aren&#39;t your business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s stare didn&#39;t waver. &#34;Funny, I was wondering why you&#39;re always caught making trouble wherever l turn up. You&#39;re harassing a girl, and yet you whine about interference? As a faculty member, it&#39;s my job to step in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gritting his teeth, Brandon jabbed a finger toward Tillie, who had tucked herself behind Alexia. &#34;She&#39;s my girlfriend.What happens between us isn&#39;t your concern!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry flickered in Tillie&#39;s eyes as she pleaded, &#34;Don&#39;t believe him. We&#39;re not together anymore! Brandon&#39;s just tryìng to force me into drinking with other men, but | won&#39;t go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tillie&#39;s courage took Brandon by surprise. He gave a bitter, mocking laugh. &#34;Oh, please. You&#39;ve done this plenty of thnes before. I&#39;ve got pictures, remember? Don&#39;t act like some innocent angel now. The hypocrisy from you broke folks is unbelievable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does it matter if she&#39;s done this before?&#34; Alexia stepped forward, her heeIs striking the pavement with a crisp warning that made Brandon retreat instinctively. She grabbed the collar of his jersey, the cold gleam of her platinum watch stung his eyes. &#34;Pressuring a girl to drink with men and hoarding private pictures-do you think the police care more about your excuses or the evidence you keep on your phone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon yanked himself away and flashed a wicked grin. &#34;You really think you can stop me? P&#39;ll spread those photos everywhere. The whole campus will know what Tillie&#39;s really like! Let&#39;s see who&#39;s ruined first!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The threat drained the color from Tillie&#39;s cheeks. Tears threatened at her eyes, and a faint tremor ran through her as she whispered, &#34;Please, don&#39;t...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia caught the distress in her eyes. With a reassuring touch on Tillie&#39;s shoulder, she signaled that there was nothing to fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Alexia face Brandon straight on, her voice cutting through the air. &#34;Brandon, you really think those pictures make you untouchable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sneer curled Brandon&#39;s mouth as he retorted, &#34;Who do you think you are, Alexia? You&#39;re just a teacher-don&#39;t get above yourself. The Gibsons don&#39;t answer to you. You should walk away while you still can, or l&#39;ll have Roger fire you myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a cool, mocking curve to Alexia&#39;s smile. &#34;The Gibson family, you say? Given your misdeeds,their name barely holds together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing her phone from her pocket, Alexia held it up so Brandon couldn&#39;t miss it.&#34;I&#39;ve got your threats on record. Should I send it to the police or let the school board hear for themselves? How do you think they&#39;ll respond?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock flashed across Brandon&#39;s face. Clearly, he hadn&#39;t counted on Alexia playing her own hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched his jaw, spitting out the words. &#34;You really think you can threaten me? Roger won&#39;t let this slide.Whether you go to the school or the police, it won&#39;t change anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Big talk for someone backed into a comer.&#34; Amusement flickered across Alexia&#39;s face. &#34;But you haven&#39;t seen anything I won&#39;t dare.&#34;</p>
