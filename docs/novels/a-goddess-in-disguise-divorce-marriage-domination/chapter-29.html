                <p>Alexia didn&#39;t want to waste time with Marilee. &#34;Step aside. I&#39;m not here to play games with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee was furious. &#34;Where&#39;s that attitude coming from? Did you forget where you came from? You dare parade around after everything you&#39;ve been through?Alexia, you&#39;re nothing but a fraud. You honestly believe you&#39;re-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s hand shot out before the insult could land,fingers closing around Marilee&#39;s necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chain drew tight, yanking Marilee forwNard into a clumsy,humiliating bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic seized Marilee as the threat of choking drove every other thought from her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation flooded her expression as she looked up, only to find Alexia watching with a cold, almost taunting smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely in control, Alexia gave Marilee&#39;s cheek a gentle pat, as though scolding a stubborn child. &#34;So you think you&#39;re superior? Funny, since you&#39;re the one bowing now. Maybe next time, you&#39;ll think before spouting nonsense. Right here, right now, I call the shots.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s grip only tightened, choking off any chance for Marilee to cry out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color drained from Marilee&#39;s face as her vision blurred. &#34;Let... go...&#34; The world went white as she struggled for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfaction gleamed in Alexia&#39;s eyes as she leaned in. &#34;Here&#39;s the thing, Marilee... I don&#39;t put up with pests. Don&#39;t mistake my patience for weakness. Next time you cross the line, you&#39;ll wish you hadn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that, Alexia let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee collapsed, clutching her throat as she coughed and gagged, fear etched in every feature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee coughed and retched, her eyes filled with fear and hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia gave her a cold glance and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left behind, Marilee shivered, a chilling dread creeping over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dragged herself to the restroom, eyes wide as she caught the angry red line across her neck in the mirror-already darkening with bruises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stormed out of the restroom, only to be stopped by a male voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marilee, what are you doing out here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee&#39;s eyes widened at the sight of Roger-supposedly bedridden in the hospital-standing there in a sharp suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Burying the surge of panic, Marilee threw herself into Roger&#39;s arms, her tears shimmering. &#34;Roger!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arms tightened around her, eyes darting over her features. &#34;Tell me who hurt you. What happened to your neck?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streaming, Marilee cried out, &#34;I was at the party with a friend when I ran into Alexia. She went after me without mercy. I&#39;m terrified. She&#39;s never forgiven me for taking everything away from her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sympathy darkened Roger&#39;s expression. He reassured her gently, &#34;Alexia&#39;s only lashing out because she envies you. I promise, I won&#39;t let her treat you this way again. But how did she even get invited here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glimmer of bitterness flickered in Marilee&#39;s gaze.&#34;She always manages to use men to get what she wants. Every time, she cozies up to the right people and finds a way in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer made Roger&#39;s temper flare. He replied with a scoff, &#34;That woman never quits! Let&#39;s go settle this once and for all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Alexia had slipped out onto the balcony,letting the night air calm her nerves. Before long,a stylish woman approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me, miss. Is the necklace you&#39;re wearing the Stellar designed by Edward Diaz?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unexpected question made Alexia&#39;s fingers drift to her necklace. She nodded. &#34;Yes, it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How lovely! Please hold still a moment. I just want to see it up close.&#34; The woman&#39;s admiration was obvious. &#34;That necklace is incredible, and it matches your look perfectly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little flustered, Alexia managed a small smile.&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing her red glasses up her nose, the woman asked, &#34;Did your boyfriend give you this necklace?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, actually. It was a friend,&#34; Alexia said after a brief hesitation. Defining her connection with Waylon wasn&#39;t easy, so she settled for his description.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flickered across the woman&#39;s face. &#34;Only a friend? Are you sure? The Stellar wasn&#39;t made to be given lightly. It&#39;s part of a couple&#39;s set-there&#39;s a matching men&#39;s ring designed for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That revelation caught Alexia off guard. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must not know the whole story,&#34; the woman replied, her disappointment quickly shifting into enthusiasm. &#34;Legend has it the designer found inspiration in a star called CX330-famous for its solitary beauty.&#34;</p>
