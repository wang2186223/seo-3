                <p>At the restaurant, Alexia didn&#39;t hold back and ordered enough dishes to cover the entire table. She even toyed with the idea of adding a cocktail for some liquid courage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the weight of Waylon&#39;s piercing stare made her rethink it. In the end, she settled for a glass of juice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they waited for their meals, Alexia tried to break the tension. She cleared her throat, fumbling for words. &#34;About what happened last night... I was pretty out of it. I was drunk. I crossed a line, and I shouldn&#39;t have dragged you into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon, completely unbothered, looked as though he&#39;d been expecting this. &#34;How much do you actually remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia hesitated, chewing on her lip as she tried to piece things together. &#34;Um... I remember kissing you.That&#39;s about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill crept into Waylon&#39;s voice. &#34;Just that? You don&#39;t remember anything else? Nothing from before or after?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered in Alexia&#39;s eyes. She seemed to be silently asking, &#34;What else did I miss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her bewildered face, Waylon feIt a strange mix of annoyance and helplessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reminded her, &#34;Do you even recall why I was there in the first place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Starving, Alexia grabbed a cherry tomato and took a big bite before she answered, &#34;Now that you mention it, I wanted to ask you that, too. What&#39;s the reason you showed up? You looked upset, and you and Sylvia were about to start a fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, Waylon&#39;s face went still, and a faint twitch pulled at the edge of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking back, he was beyond grateful that he&#39;d managed to leave when he did. If he hadn&#39;t, Alexia would probably be denying everything right now, and she&#39;d have gotten away with even more than just a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter appeared with their food just then, placing a plate of beef stew and mashed potatoes in front of Alexia. She picked up her spoon, ready to eat, but Waylon&#39;s voice drifted across the table, calm and clear. &#34;I was jealous. That&#39;s why I came.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Alexia&#39;s spoon clattered onto the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Waylon simply nodded at the waiter to bring her a replacement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the waiter brought over a fresh spoon,Waylon noticed Alexia still staring blankly, caught completely off guard. &#34;You look shocked. Didn&#39;t expect me to say that, did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia remained rooted in place, almost as if she hadn&#39;t heard him at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon leaned in, voice steady. &#34;No matter how surprised you are, I&#39;m not taking it back. And you can&#39;t pretend those words didn&#39;t reach you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fluistered, Alexia grabbed her spoon and dug into her stew, clearly hoping to change the subject. &#34;Can we just eat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s gaze turned unreadable, shadows flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, the server placed a steaming plate of crawfish on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia slipped on a pair of gloves and started peeling,but soon realized Waylon hadn&#39;t touched his food,the tension growing between them. Trying to lighten the mood, she asked, &#34;You&#39;re not hungry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon rested his chin on his hand, watching her with lazy amusement. &#34;Why don&#39;t you peel one for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia shot him a look. &#34;Half the point of eating crawfish is doing it yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint smile, Waylon replied, &#34;I can live without that experience. You do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation flashed across Alexia&#39;s face as she bit into a piece of crawfish, shooting him a glare. &#34;You&#39;re pushing your luck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s laughter was quiet but unmistakable. &#34;And some people are quite skilled at acting clueless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia was about to answer, but before she could get a word out, a woman&#39;s voice called out, smooth and pleasant, &#34;Mr.Mason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning, Alexia spotted a young woman in a smoky lavender silk dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long, glossy waves of hair framed her delicate features. Her skin glowed under the crystal chandelier, and a pair of dramatic, blood-red gemstone earrings sparkled at her ears, completing her striking look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An absolutely gorgeous woman! Alexia took in the woman&#39;s elegance, unable to hide her admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quietly sipped her juice, watching the exchange unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon raised an eyebrow, showing mild surprise,though his voice stayed as frosty as ever. &#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, the woman hesitated, but quickly found her composure. &#34;Oh, nothing important. I&#39;m just out with friends and happened to notice you here,so | wanted to say hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon offered nothing in return, letting a heavy silence fill the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the quiet stretched on, the woman tried again,forcing a cheerful tone. &#34;By the way, my birthday&#39;s coming up next week. Will you be able to make it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s answer was swift and unyielding. &#34;I won&#39;t.I&#39;m busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly caught off guard by his bluntness, she blinked in surprise. &#34;But your grandfather mentioned you&#39;d be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That comment made something inside Alexia tighten.She shot a glance at Waylon, noticing how his face darkened for just a second before he masked it with his usual cool indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re relyìng on my grandfather&#39;s promises, why bother asking me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman wasn&#39;t about to give up that easily. She kept her smile in place, brushing off the rejection with practiced grace. &#34;Well, even if you skip the party, I&#39;ll look forward to your present.&#34; She let her gaze slide over to Alexia, a not-so-subtle challenge in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s looks were impossible to ignore, and the woman, Selena Brooks, took note-she studied Alexia with barely hidden suspicion before returning her attention to Waylon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sweet, almost innocent smile, she asked Waylon, &#34;And who might this be? Are you going to introduce us?&#34;</p>
