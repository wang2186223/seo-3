                <p>Marilee latched onto Roger&#39;s arm like her life depended on it, the two of them looking like a pair from some overdone drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen chuckled bitterly and shook his head. &#34;If you had insisted on marrying Marilee back then, do you think we could&#39;ve stopped you? The Jenkins family isn&#39;t some giant we couldn&#39;t touch. Roger, you always play it safe, and that&#39;s exactly why you keep losing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Roger defied them at the time, Allen would&#39;ve been furious but also proud. At least then, his grandson would&#39;ve shown some backbone, some drive to take control of his own life. But instead,Roger had become a man who couldn&#39;t even manage his personal affairs, let alone accomplish anything meaningful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen never liked interfering in Roger&#39;s private life,but in his opinion, no real man would let both his marriage and his family spiral into such chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger had really let him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brandon, who&#39;d been watching everything like a spectator at a show, suddenly laughed out loud. &#34;So Roger&#39;s heart was always with Marilee, huh? Two whole years, and he never once touched you, Alexia. How pitiful! No matter how hard you tried, you were never the real deal. No matter how tightly you hold on to what doesn&#39;t belong to you, it&#39;ll eventually slip through your fingers and return to its rightful owner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That kind of marriage, that kind of man?&#34; Alexia scoffed. &#34;No, thanks. Since the divorce talk, life&#39;s been way better. There are tons of men out there who are more decent than Roger. His so-called loyalty? Not even worth pocket change. If Marilee wants it, she can have it-I&#39;m not interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s face darkened, his fists tightening at his sides.&#34;Alexia, do you really have to be so cruel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee stood by his side with tears in her eyes, but inside, her heart was burning with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia met Roger&#39;s eyes without a shred of hesitation. &#34;Does it sting to hear the truth? Good.That&#39;s exactly why I said it. What are you going to do about it? Endure it, just like I had to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger looked like he was going to explode, but Alexia turned her attention to Brandon, who still had that smug look. &#34;By the way, Brandon,aside from trying to kill me, remember that other nasty thing you did?I wasn&#39;t bluffing-push me again and I&#39;ll forward that report straight to the top brass before the bidding even starts. Forget the bid; the Gibson family won&#39;t even get to show up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s grin disappeared in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen picked up on the tension and frowned. &#34;What report? What is she talking about? Brandon, what exactly did you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor could sense the whole thing spiraling out of control. She gently held Alexia&#39;s hand, her tone Abs..urgent. &#34;Alexia, please, can you do this for me? I know I&#39;m asking a lot, but if you just agree to let it go and not report anything, I&#39;ll give you whatever you want.Anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia looked down at Eleanor&#39;s aged hands gripping hers tightly, as if she were the only hope left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how exactly do you plan to fix this, Eleanor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s eyes lit up with a hint of hope. &#34;How about this? You and Roger finalize the divorce right away,and he gives you half of his personal assets.Would that be acceptable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s head shot up. &#34;Absolutely not! We signed a prenup, and she&#39;s not entitled to much. Why should she walk away with half my wealth now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s patience snapped. &#34;If you don&#39;t agree,Marilee&#39;s reputation will be ruined, our family will lose the bid, and Brandon might end up behind bars.Don&#39;t you get it? Sometimes you&#39;ve got to pay up to protect the bigger picture. I don&#39;t care if you love her or not, at the very least, you shouldn&#39;t be this stingy  or cruel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s words left Roger completely speechless.He could only grit his teeth and stare at the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back to Alexia, Eleanor softened her tone again. &#34;Alexia, would that be acceptable to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia didn&#39;t even flinch. Her voice was flat. &#34;Half?That&#39;s too generous. I want him to walk away with absolutely nothing.&#34;</p>
