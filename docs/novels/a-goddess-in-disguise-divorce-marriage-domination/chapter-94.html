                <p>Waylon hadn&#39;t really been checking social media lately, but late that night, his phone buzzed with a message from Elton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable! After Alexia ditched her husband,she&#39;d rather seek the company of a male escort.Imagine that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attached beneath it was a screenshot of Ada&#39;s latest post.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s brows knitted together, and as he scrolled through the photos, a shadow passed over his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes stayed on the picture of Alexia smiling with a group of men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, he stood up and walked out.On his way, he bumped into Simon, who was coming in with coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon looked confused. &#34;Mr. Mason, where are you headed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon gave a cold smile. &#34;To go get someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the stormy look on his face, Simon offered quickly, &#34;I&#39;ll come along. I&#39;ll driv/e.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No thanks,&#34; Waylon replied curtly. &#34;You&#39;re too slow behind the wheel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without another glance, he turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon stood there, momentarily dejected by the rejection. But then it hit him-Waylon was going to drive himself. Panic started to bubble up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon wasn&#39;t just fast-he drove like he owned the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And judging by his expression, tonight&#39;s drive might be wild enough to cost him his license.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervous, Simon grabbed his keys, ready to follow,but by the time he got downstairs, Waylon had already roared off in his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Elton leaned back in his chair, looking pleased with himself. He&#39;d done his part and could already picture the chaos about to hit Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Bella walked over and quietly handed him a fresh cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elton took a sip, nodding with approval. &#34;You&#39;re getting better at this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bella gave a faint smile. &#34;I&#39;m glad it suits your taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at her always composed, almost expressionless face, Elton asked, &#34;Don&#39;t you ever feel lonely, being with me like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bella looked slightly caught off guard, then gently shook her head. &#34;You&#39;ve always treated me kindly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still, being under someone else&#39;s thumb can&#39;t be truly fulfilling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bella kept her eyes lowered, her voice calm and firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never cared much about freedom. What matters more to me are the things I can keep, like comfort and security, not some unclear feeling of being emotionally free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elton chuckled at her reply and tilted her chin up.&#34;You really are clever, even if you act like you&#39;re made of stone. Do you still have Alexia&#39;s business card?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bella stayed quiet for a few seconds, then slowly shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elton smiled faintly as he lightly traced her lips with his thumb, the gesture both gentle and warning.&#34;If that&#39;s really the case, good. But if I find out otherwise, you won&#39;t like it. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bella nodded, calm as ever. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia remained completely unaware of what was heading her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia happened to draw the King card this time.Alexia had a strange feeling in her gut, and not the good kind. Her instinct proved right when Sylvia shot her a sly grin and pointed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia, how about giving the guy next to you a kiss?Come on, we&#39;re not breaking any laws here.Honestly, this is the best age for a man, full of charm.Think about it. Men cheat all the time, even when they&#39;re married. So why shouldn&#39;t you,as a divorced woman, get to explore a little, too? The world is full of delicious options, and we deserve to enjoy them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young man beside Alexia gave an encouraging smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, Alexia was far from an ordinary client. Sure,money mattered in his line of work, but when a woman looked like that, charm often overtook price tags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beauty like hers didn&#39;t walk in every day. He was eager, his eyes lighting up as he subtly leaned closer and closed his eyes, waiting for her to come in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia hesitated, her mind swirling with thoughts she didn&#39;t expect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it really that easy? Could she really satisfy her desires with someone she barely knew? Was it possible to separate the heart from physical longing so easily?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was inches away, about to place a soft kiss on the young man&#39;s cheek, when a sudden noise from outside shattered the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door burst open without warning, making Sylvia and Ada jump in surprise. Alexia&#39;s head snapped toward the noise, and her whole body went still when she saw who was standing there.</p>
