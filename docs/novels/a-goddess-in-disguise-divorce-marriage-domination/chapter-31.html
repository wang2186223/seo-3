                <p>Roger&#39;s eyes narrowed as he took in the sudden confrontation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, the chatter around them faded, and every head turned, curiosity and excitement burning in their eyes. A cold shiver crept up Roger&#39;s spine as he clenched his fists in silent frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Alexia&#39;s surprise, Waylon&#39;s usual composure had vanished, his features shadowed with anger.Furrowed brows and tight lips made it clear-he was truly upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced away, keeping her voice casual. &#34;You didn&#39;t have to come. Is everything handled?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Towering over the group, Waylon replied, &#34;It&#39;s finished. I just heard some commotion and thought l should see for myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee trembled where she stood, biting down on her lip and shrinking from Waylon&#39;s frigid stare. One look from him was enough to make anyone shudder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger, too, struggled beneath Waylon&#39;s presence.For a moment, he felt like a child again, powerless and exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bracing himself, Roger forced out a protest. &#34;Alexia,we&#39;re not even officially divorced. Isn&#39;t it wrong for you to be so close to Mr. Mason?&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter spilled from Alexia before she could stop herself. The irony wasn&#39;t lost on her-Roger had Marilee on his arm, yet he dared to question her choices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could retort, Waylon&#39;s steely glare cut right through Roger. &#34;What&#39;s wrong about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single look from Waylon was enough to make Roger feel as if he&#39;d been cut to the bone, the man&#39;s presence as overwhelming as a crashing wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a word escaped Roger&#39;s lips. &#34;I asked you a question.&#34; Waylon&#39;s tone cast a heavy stillness over the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spectators found themselves almost pitying Roger as the tension mounted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Commanding respect and emotion with nothing but his bearing, Waylon could easily set the tone-whether warm and gracious, or chillingly severe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One question from him, and Roger&#39;s confidence evaporated-leaving only a cold sweat behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen&#39;s advice flashed through Roger&#39;s mind, helping him gather his wits. &#34;Sorry, I was being rude. Mr.Mason, I&#39;ll take a glass of wine as an apology.&#34;Without waiting for a response, he snatched a glass of hard liquor from a passing tray and swallowed it in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body, still weak from illness, reeled under the harsh burn of alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Waylon gestured for the waiter to refill the glass. &#34;Keep going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although no names were uttered, Roger stiffened from head to toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension gripped the hall, the only sound breaking the silence was the distant, unwavering music, making the air feel even heavier. Marilee clung to Roger, fear written across her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stories about Waylon had swirled for seven years,painting him as a man who controlled the world around him with almost effortless authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite how far-fetched the stories became,everyone knew his influence was real. He didn&#39;t need rumors to prove his power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, in full view of everyone, Waylon made it clear he was singling Roger out. There was nothing subtle or hidden about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left without any hope of matching such force, Roger found himself completely outmatched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounded by onlookers, Roger swallowed his pride, his hand trembling as he reached for the glass again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Roger tossed back the drink, Waylon&#39;s voice remained level. &#34;Have another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several rounds later, Roger&#39;s legs barely supported him,his vision swimming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strangely, not a single soul spoke in his defense or tried to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the sidelines, Elton and Korbin exchanged amused looks, clearly entertained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elton quipped, &#34;Think we should get you an ambulance? I don&#39;t think you can last much longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding his teeth, Roger spat out, &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin only smirked. &#34;Oh, so you want to keep going?A few more rounds might sharpen your senses, if anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every sip burned Roger&#39;s throat and left his insides in turmoil, yet he recognized the ridicule behind their words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No attempt was made to hide the insult. It was clear they wanted him to see just how powerless he was next to Waylon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the next drink poured, Roger paused,uncertainty flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elton arched a brow, taunting him, &#34;What&#39;s wrong?Thinking of quitting? You should know, the results are in for Griffinham&#39;s final legal gambling license.Only Gibson Group and Braxton Group made the cut.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger snapped back to attention. &#34;Braxton Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right on cue, Matteo Braxton stepped forward from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a while, Roger.&#34; Matteo, whose intense stare and sharp brow gave him a formidable presence, matched Roger&#39;s age but outmatched him in confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sight of his old enemy, Roger felt his resolve slipping. Everyone knew the bitter history between the Gibson family and the Braxton family. Once, the latter had been brought low by Roger&#39;s family. Now, here Matteo was, fighting toe-to-toe for their state&#39;s last gambling license.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation felt almost absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension hardened Roger&#39;s expression. &#34;There&#39;s no way this is happening. How did Braxton Group even manage to get into the Chamber of Commerce? The Gibson family&#39;s casino has always outperformed the Braxton family&#39;s in every way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Decisions like that aren&#39;t for you to make,&#34; Elton replied smoothly, casting a glance at Waylon. &#34;How about we settle things right here, right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away from the crowd, Waylon fixed his gaze on Alexia. &#34;How would you like to decide?&#34;</p>
