                <p>Alexia stood tall in the face of their derision. &#34;You&#39;ve lost the right to negotiate with me. Marilee paid criminals to abduct me, and Brandon tried to kill me.How ironic, Roger-these are the very people you hold dear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cold words hung in the air, each syllable sharper than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger went rigid at the accusation, Marilee&#39;s name knocking the wind from him. &#34;Alexia, that&#39;s outrageous! Don&#39;t throw wild accusations around.How could Marilee possibly be involved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen and Eleanor exchanged worried glances,anxiety creeping into their features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen&#39;s voice was gravelly. &#34;Someone needs to explain what&#39;s happening here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s tone softened, supportive. &#34;Don&#39;t let them intimidate vou, Alexia. Start from the beginning Tell us everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under their urging, Alexia laid out every detail,holding nothing back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her story unfolded, the tension in the room grew thick-her ordeal was almost tangible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen&#39;s hands clenched as he listened, his anger rising with every word about Brandon&#39;s treachery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes stinging with disappointment, he rounded on his grandson. &#34;You&#39;re an utter disgrace!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Alexia been telling the truth-and if Brandon hadn&#39;t turned traitor halfway through-she could have handled the Black Tiger Gang alone. The Gibson family could have flipped the whole situation,wiped out the gang, and cleared Brandon&#39;s debt in one stroke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But thanks to Brandon&#39;s lack of foresight, everything fell apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once so boastful, Brandon now shrank under Allen&#39;s furious glare, not daring to utter a single protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s voice was cold with contempt. &#34;Maybe Brandon&#39;s attempt to kill me was someone else&#39;s idea, but Marilee hired the Black Tiger Gang to kidnap me. Roger, how do you plan to answer for vour girlfriend&#39;s crimes? You&#39;d hate for her dirty laundry to become public, wouldn&#39;t you? It&#39;d be a shame for her to be blacklisted and hounded out of show business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tapped her phone, letting the recording fill the room with Marilee&#39;s unmistakable voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia&#39;s at Afoross University. Grab her in the parking lot. You know what to do after that, right?Don&#39;t forget to send me the video when it&#39;s done.And make sure Roger gets a copy anonymously-l bet he&#39;ll love watching it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria&#39;s composure crumbled. &#34;Why drag Roger into this? Even if this is all true, blame the Jenkins family for raising Marilee so poorly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? You think he can just walk away from this scandal?&#34; Alexia&#39;s reply was cold, her gaze pinning Roger to the spot. &#34;Roger, you once publicly declared you&#39;d marry Marilee, even if it meant wearing the stain of adultery. With that kind of love,I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll stand tall and face the consequences,won&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s complexion drained of color. &#34;I will never accept a woman like her into this family! Roger, pick up your phone. Call Marilee here-now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger hesitated, voice faltering. &#34;She might have other commitments right now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shot him a withering look. &#34;If she doesn&#39;t show up today, she can forget about ever setting foot in this house again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no options, Roger made the call and arranged a car to fetch Marilee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Marilee finally arrived, anxiety clung to her.She scanned the room, confusion written on her face, until her eyes landed on Alexia-standing there with a cold, imperious presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of foreboding crept into Marilee&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to sound innocent, she moved toward Roger.&#34;Roger, what&#39;s the matter? Why does everyone look so serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shot to her feet and delivered a stinging slap.&#34;You dare play dumb with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smack erased every ounce of pretense from Marilee&#39;s face, fear glimmering in her eyes.&#34;Eleanor...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t call me by my name-we&#39;re not friends, and we&#39;re certainly not family,&#34; Eleanor retorted. WVithin the Gibson family, even Allen respected her authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia offered a graceful, mocking glance. &#34;Drop the act, Marilee. Seeing me here in one piece-does that ruin your day? Or are you too busy wondering what happened to your hired goons?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of panic flickered in Marilee&#39;s eyes; her heart thudded painfully in her chest. How on earth did Alexia uncover her plot so fast?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting her lip, Marilee forced a weak smile. &#34;I have no idea what you mean. Alexia, are you always this paranoid? You see conspiracies everywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s smirk widened. &#34;Paranoia or not, the truth always has a way of surfacing in court.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed play on her phone, letting Marilee&#39;s incriminating words echo through the room once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each damning sentence, Marilee&#39;s face drained of color. A chill crawled down her spine as beads of cold sweat broke out along her skin.</p>
