                <p>It was the first time Alexia had ever asked about Waylon&#39;s past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a composed expression and that calm air he always carried, Waylon simply replied, &#34;If we&#39;re talking about the results, yes-l&#39;ve been alright.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like they silently agreed not to bring up those missing seven years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t just learn the waltz for fun,&#34; Alexia said with a casual shrug. &#34;I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve forgotten the bet,though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, she had followed Waylon relentlessly from one competition to another. Always trying to catch up. Sometimes winning, often losing, but never backing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waltz? That had been a penalty. A playful one,maybe, but it mattered. She&#39;d lost a bet back then,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and the price was simple-she had to be his partner for his formal dance event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that dance never happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That year, a lot happened within the Mason family,and because of their reckless youth, they ended up going their separate ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when Alexia thought he wouldn&#39;t say a word,Waylon unexpectedly pulled her into his arms. She felt weightless, like a feather caught on the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arm wrapped around her waist as he lowered his gaze to meet hers.&#34;I remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he looked at her-focused, unwavering-made her heart skip a beat. His chiseled features were striking, but it was that quiet intensity in his gaze that stole her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the dance came to a close,the hall was filled with applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a deep voice rang out from behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Mason, it&#39;s been a long time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They turned to see a middle-aged man dressed in a pristine white suit. He had clearly been watching from a distance and only approached now that the music had stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s expression cooled ever so slightly as he recognized the man. &#34;Mr. Walsh. It has been a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, yes. The last time was... five years ago? In Aelholt, wasn&#39;t it? I must say, you&#39;ve only become more impressive with time.&#34; Johann Walsh chuckled as he stepped forward, rubbing his hands together in an almost nervous gesture. His eyes shifted toward Alexia, and that initial politeness gave way to open admiration. &#34;This young lady beside you is breathtaking. My own date tonight doesn&#39;t come close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s gaze darkened the moment he caught Johann eyeing Alexia a bit too boldly. His voice turned frosty. &#34;Do you have a reason for staring?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johann chuckled, caught off guard.&#34;Ahno offense meant. Just a bit of harmless admiration. Honestly,talking business with you is always difficult, Mr.Mason. Maybe I should&#39;ve tried my luck with the lady first-might&#39;ve had better odds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia smiled coolly. &#34;Then you&#39;d be making a mistake. Business and friendship don&#39;t mix when it comes to Waylon. If you want to work with him,sincerity&#39;s the only way in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johann&#39;s smile faltered. He looked at her more closely now, realizing this wasn&#39;t someone to be underestimated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon noticed the change in Johann&#39;s demeanor and raised a brow. &#34;So then, what exactly brings you here tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johann straightened his tie, trying to regain composure. &#34;On behalf of Blackcurrant Group, I&#39;m here to explore potential collaborations. From what I&#39;ve seen, your company&#39;s shifted its focus to bioengineering in recent years, with quite a few major initiatives underway. We&#39;re extremely interested.After all, the future lies in biotech, and our firm is globally recognized for that. Especially our latest initiative, the Daylight Project-it&#39;s all about advancing human welfare. There&#39;s plenty of synergy between us,I believe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he finished, Alexia let out a light laugh,clearly amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johann&#39;s confidence wavered under her stare.Frowning, he asked, &#34;May I ask what you find so funny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia didn&#39;t soften the blow. &#34;Over the past few years, Goldedge has seen multiple outbreaks-new viruses showing up one after another. Preliminary findings pointed to human-made biochemical tampering. And though the reports were conveniently buried, guess whose name kept popping up?Blackcurrant Group. So tell me, have you really turned things around in just two years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johann&#39;s heart thudded uneasily. The hit had landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone sharpened as he leaned in. &#34;That&#39;s slander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether there&#39;s evidence or not, technology is neutral-it&#39;s how it&#39;s used that matters. If you let unproven gossip cloud your judgment, you&#39;ll only slow your own advancement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s eyes gleamed with cool defiance. &#34;Don&#39;t get it twisted. I&#39;m not against biotech, and I&#39;m not throwing baseless shade at your company. I&#39;m pointing at you. As someone in charge, you either overlooked or enabled everything that happened in Goldedge. That&#39;s not unfortunate-that&#39;s incompetence. If you can&#39;t even control your own team, what makes you think we&#39;d trust you here?A company buried in scandals pretending to serve humanity? Please. Save the PR for someone gullible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johann&#39;s face changed the second her words hit home. He clearly hadn&#39;t expected Alexia to be so blunt, but since she was, there was no point in pretending. &#34;This world runs on power. There are leaders, and there are followers. Technology is just another weapon to keep the upper hand. I&#39;m sure Mr.Mason knows that better than anyone.&#34;</p>
