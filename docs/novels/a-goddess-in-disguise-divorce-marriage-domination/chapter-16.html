                <p>Nothing in Waylon&#39;s face gave away a hint of mercy His voice cut through the stillness, cool and measured.&#34;Five years. You work for me. For Free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air in the room seemed to freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, only Waylon would twist a simple wager into a five-year sentence. That was the signature move of Afoross&#39;s own financial predator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No argument left Alexia&#39;s lips. Without a word, she followed the club staff to sign up, scrawled her name on the paperwork, and disappeared into the changing room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not Long after, an event official at the registration desk stopped cold, his eyes glued to the list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There it was: Black Swan. The name hit like a jolt of electricity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Black Swan was a legend who had blown away the national scene half a decade ago. Ten shots in thirty seconds. Perfect score. Then she dropped off the face of the earth. No press. No competitions. Not a whisper since that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably a fluke. Just someone else using the name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little later, Alexia stepped into the hallway outside the locker room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her new look turned heads-a crisp, custom riding suit cut to perfection, a shadowy cowboy hat drawn low and a black mask obscuring her eyes. Even so, her poise and the sharp line of her jaw made her impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the exclusive lounge, Elton cut Waylon a skeptical glance. &#34;Tell me you didn&#39;t put everything on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, the city&#39;s elite used the club as a playground. Rich folks threw down outrageous bets,ran their own contests, and nobody blinked. This year,though, everyone had their eyes on Royal Lion and Black Mamba-the two top contenders out for the title.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, you have doubts about her?&#34; Waylon replied in an even, careless tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin leaned back, not even pretending to be impressed. &#34;Not my money on the line. I&#39;m covering both Black Mamba and Royal Lion-can&#39;t lose that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada rolled her eyes, patience thin. &#34;Come on. Alexia&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>going to surprise everyone. I&#39;m backing her all the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin let out a laugh, short and sharp. &#34;Royal Lion and Black MMamba have crushed every challenger for the past two years. Alexia? She&#39;s a total unknown.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, the digital display above the arena pulsed to life, pushing out one name in giant white letters-Black Swan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A vivid animation splashed across the screen: masked rider,hat low, every inch an enigma straight out of a blockbuster film.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Korbin lost his swagger. None of this sat right with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side,Alexia joined the other competitors,moving into the waiting area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone hoping to master mounted archery needed nerves of steel and the hands of a surgeon. That challenge doubled with the underground circuit&#39;s mixed roster-Alexia was the only woman facing down a lineup of men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd couldn&#39;t help themselves-conversations buzzed the moment she appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold up-she&#39;s here as Black Swan? That takes guts,honestly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyone got a clue who Black Swan actually is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All I know is five years ago, she became a myth. Ten flawless shots in thirty seconds, broke every record.Then-poof-gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it really her back out here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, you really buy that? Feels like one of those overblown rumors. There&#39;s no real evidence,just wild stories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say that again and see what happens!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spectators nearly came to blows, security barely keeping the peace as debate threatened to boil over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, Royal Lion and Black Mamba, both well-known veterans, exchanged a brisk handshake before giving Alexia a look that said she was invisible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Black Mamba&#39;s sneer traveled over her with open scorn. &#34;Nice try with the dramatic alias. Black Swan&#39;s old news. You&#39;re in the wrong place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Royal Lion didn&#39;t bother hiding his disdain. &#34;Why are we even wasting time? Fame-chasers come and go.Even if she&#39;s that Black Swan, one lucky streak in a backwoods tournament isn&#39;t the same as dominating here. Women never break records in this arena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia crossed her arms, her mouth curling into a smile as sharp as broken glass. &#34;How about a little wager? If I take first place, anytime my name shows up on the roster, both of you sit out. When I&#39;m in the game,you&#39;re not invited. Understood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Royal Lion bristled, scowl deepening. &#34;You&#39;re delusional.&#34; He made a move, but Black Mamba held him back, locking eyes with Alexia, curiosity flickering beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Win or lose, you&#39;ve already turned this into a spectacle. But hey, we&#39;ll gladly watch you go down in flames.Even if you really are Black Swan-after today,we&#39;ll make sure you never step foot in this sport again.&#34;</p>
