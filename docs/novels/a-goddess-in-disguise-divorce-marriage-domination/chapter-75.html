                <p>Annoyance etched across Alexia&#39;s face. &#34;Why are you trailing me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s chest heaved with each breath. &#34;Delete the recording! Do it now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Alexia could fire back, her phone screen flashed-Waylon&#39;s name lit up. She started to answer.&#34;Hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon lunged forward, reaching for her phone. &#34;Who&#39;s on the other end? Give it here! I&#39;ll erase the recording myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sidestepping his grasp, Alexia snapped, &#34;Brandon, enough of this bullshit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon, hearing the tension in her voice, frowned on the other end. Brandon? What was he doing pestering Alexia now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing more frantic, Brandon shouted, &#34;Give me your phone! You&#39;re not leaving here until I get that recording back!&#34; In a sudden burst, he yanked the driver&#39;s door open and dropped himself into the seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage colored Alexia&#39;s words. &#34;Brandon, have you lost your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her protest was cut short. Out of nowhere, hands snatched her phone from behind. Metal pressed cold and hard into her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gun. Its presence was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t make a sound,&#34; a low voice said in her ear. &#34;Get in the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia kept her composure, refusing to let fear show. Without warning, two more men emerged, forcing her roughly into the back seat. Brandon went rigid, eyes bulging with fear. &#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thug pressed the gun barrel hard against Brandon&#39;s head. &#34;Keep your mouth shut if you want to stay alive.Start driving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that command, every trace of confidence melted away. Fingers shaking, Brandon fumbled with his seatbelt, barely able to steady himself. His eyes flickered up to the rearview mirror, where Alexia&#39;s face came into focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To his disbelief, she looked back with cold calm. Not a hint of fear or distress crossed her features, nothing like the panic that had seized him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car shot from the parking structure, tires screeching, as if it had been fired from a bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon stared at his phone in fury, the abrupt call drop fueling his rage. &#34;Simon, bring the car. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon, who had heard every word, pieced the situation together-kidnapping. &#34;Mr. Mason, allow me to take care of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glare from Waylon cut him off, sharp as a blade. &#34;I won&#39;t repeat myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing his mistake, Simon felt sweat bead at his brow. &#34;Understood. I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In no time, the car was ready, and Waylon slid inside, a laptop in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they sped through the city, blue light from the laptop washed over Waylon&#39;s stern face, sharpening every feature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everyone set?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon dropped his voice. &#34;All teams are in place and fully armed. We tapped intocity surveillance using the license plate. The manhunt has already begun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s hands danced rapidly across the keyboard, streaming live feeds from the university&#39;s parking lot straight onto his screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the screen, Brandon was behind the wheel, visibly rattled, and the armed thug beside him made Waylon&#39;s eyes narrow with pure,lethal intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Alexia looked unruffled on camera, Waylon recognized the mask she wore for protection-cool,unreadable, but never truly calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These men, judging by their ruthlessness, had a history of violence. Waylon understood the stakes.Every second counted if he was going to save her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Brandon-utterly worthless bastard in a crisis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold fury flickered across Waylon&#39;s face. He spoke with cutting clarity.&#34;Call Roger. Tell him to come pick up his useless cousin,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon gave a swift nod and got to work without pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The getaway car screeched to a halt outside an abandoned factory on the city&#39;s edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding out of the passenger seat, the scar-faced thug led the charge, his crew right behind him.Without warning, they jerked Alexia and Brandon from the car and hustled them inside, leaving no room for resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, check out the lady-she&#39;s something else,&#34; one goon sneered, eyes hungry. &#34;You take the first turn.I&#39;ll handle the man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wicked grin stretched across the scar-faced man&#39;s lips as he turned his full attention to Alexia, his gaze crawling over her with shameless anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornered in that rundown building, Alexia&#39;s allure only seemed to intensify-long hair spilling over her cheeks, delicate lines caught in the flickering light. Even in plain jeans and a crisp shirt, her figure turned every head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody could call her ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder that jealous actress had wanted her gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaggering over with a mocking grin, the scar-faced thug clicked his tongue.&#34;Wel, aren&#39;t you something.Never picked up a catch like you before. Behave, darling, and I might just show you some kindness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his hand reached out, Alexia smoothly turned away, dodging his grasp as if he were nothing more than a bothersome insect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting second, something dangerous flashed in her eyes. It vanished, replaced by a mocking smile.&#34;By the way your men cower, you must be the big boss. Hilarious. Funny how a &#39;leader&#39;like you has to kidnap a woman for attention. You must really be scraping the barrel these days. I bet you jump at any gutter job that comes your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit their mark. The henchmen&#39;s tempers flared, one snapping, &#34;Shut it! We&#39;re with the Black Tiger Gang! You think we&#39;re some nobodies? You&#39;re way outta your league!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Black Tiger Gang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition flickered in Alexia&#39;s mind. Ada had once warned her about this crew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clty&#39;s underworld had long been infected by thelf coruption--Black Tiger Gang was infamous for its backroom deals, tron-fisted rackets, and willingness to get dirty for a price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden gust rattled the battered doors, thet hinges shrieking in protest as wind tore through the ruined factory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting her head, Alexiá mocked, &#34;So it&#39;s the famos Black Tiger Gang? The police is cracking down on yOUF Kind,yet you dare to kidnap me. Your employer must really hate me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scar-faced boss seized her chin, leering as he forced her to meet his gaze.&#34;Look at that-brains and beauty. Think you&#39;ll trick me into talking? Not a chance. You guessed one thing right, though. The police are swarming everywhere, so tonight, we&#39;re taking what we want before they find us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His filthy fingers inched toward the front of her shirt, intent on tearing through the fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet just as he moved in, Alexia&#39;s mouth twisted into a cold, pitiless grin. In one fluid movement, she slipped her wrists from the rope.</p>
