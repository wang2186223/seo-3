                <p>Since Marilee wanted to stir up a media war, Alexia figured she might as well join the game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her post, it didn&#39;t take long for the internet to explode with reactions. Within minutes,her follower count exploded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee&#39;s supporters were quick to attack, flooding Alexia&#39;s inbox with hateful messages. Onlookers were stunned that Alexia, branded as the &#39;fake daughter,&#39; still had the guts to announce a live stream despite the backlash. But once people actually watched what she posted, they were drawn in. It was surprisingly entertaining, enough to make them hit that follow button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear that tonight&#39;s live stream was going to be wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While thousands were setting reminders for the broadcast, Alexia pulled up outside Waylon&#39;s company building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Waylon stepped out of a meeting room, followed closely by Simon.,regarding today&#39;s lunch arrangements...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t I say to cancel this week&#39;s lunch orders?&#34; Waylon said, checking his watch. &#34;And make sure the front desk doesn&#39;t delay Alexia&#39;s entry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon quickly nodded. &#34;Already taken care of. She&#39;ll get in without any holdup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia stepped into the elevator and headed straight for the top floor without any issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the elevator doors slid open, she unexpectedly came face-to-face with Waylon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood tall and composed, the light behind him casting a long silhouette across the floor. Dressed in a charcoal-gray shirt with two buttons left open, he looked effortlessly refined and striking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he saw Alexia, something changed-his usual distant look softened, and a faint smile appeared on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s heart gave a small jolt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but wonder if Waylon smiled that gently at everyone or just her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stepped into his office together. Waylon glanced over and said, &#34;Right on schedule, as always.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I&#39;m never late,&#34; Alexia replied, briefly eyeing the stylish furnishings. &#34;Nice decor, by the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon didn&#39;t comment, instead, his eyes shifted to the lunchbox in her hands, clearly more interested in what she&#39;d brought. &#34;So, what&#39;s on the menu today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll find out in a second,&#34; Alexia said cheerfully, pulling out a five-layer lunchbox with flair. &#34;Surprise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon peeked inside and spotted his favorite sweet glazed ribs, along with a spread of other neatly prepared dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t gourmet, but they clearly took time and care to make them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s quite the spread,&#34; Waylon said, looking a little impressed. He hadn&#39;t expected her to go all out.③</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia chuckled. &#34;Of course, it&#39;s not just for you. I&#39;m eating too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d promised to have lunch with him-there was no way she&#39;d bring just ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon gave a low chuckle. &#34;So the ribs were the only thing you made with me in mind,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia shot him a look. He stopped talking and reached for a shrimp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia watched him intently. &#34;Well? How is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chewed slowly, wearing a serious expression, but didn&#39;t respond right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is something wrong?&#34; she asked, growing concerned. &#34;Too salty? Did I mess it up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking uncertain, she took a bite herself and chewed slowly, but she didn&#39;t taste anything wrong.Watching her confused face,Waylon finally laughed. &#34;It&#39;s amazing. Best food I&#39;ve ever tasted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia froze for a second, then smirked and gently nudged his shoe with her foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon noticed the soft pink tint creeping up her cheeks and ears. His eyes narrowed slightly as he watched her in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he quietly looked away, but not before the thought crossed his mind-she was even more adorable than he remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia missed the way. his expression shifted. &#34;Best food you&#39;ve ever had? That&#39;s a big statement,&#34; she said with a playful smirk, lifting her chin proudly. &#34;But let&#39;s be honest, my cooking skills are way ahead of yours.You know it, I know it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cooking was the one domain where Alexia had Waylon completely beat. She didn&#39;t brag about it often, but catching Waylon off guard like this was always satisfying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon let out a quiet huff, noticing how pleased she looked. &#34;There&#39;s time. I&#39;ll catch up eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia grinned and teased, &#34;Try learning to fry an egg before making big promises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon gave a strained smile. &#34;Instead of roasting me, maybe you should focus on how to handle Marilee&#39;s online smear campaign.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s smile faded a little. &#34;You&#39;ve been reading those posts too, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon nodded. &#34;I saw some of it during a break this morning. Alexia, this isn&#39;t some harmless joke. She&#39;s clearly trying to destroy you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; Alexia said, still keeping her calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her steadily, his gaze heavy with meaning.there something you want to say to me?&#34;</p>
