            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Chapter was over. Alexia now brimmed with steel and impatience, refusing to tolerate nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This stark contrast left Evelyn feeling quite uneasy. Forcing herself to bite back, she snapped, &#34;Don&#39;t fool yourself into thinking Waylon Mason makes you important. Women like you-always counting on a pretty face-get tossed aside as soon as the novelty wears off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words rolled right off Alexia. That tired accusation had lost its sting long ago. With a scoff, she retorted,&#34;Twisting things must be your favorite hobby. Let&#39;s be honest-who&#39;s getting played here? If there&#39;s ever a wedding, trust me, it&#39;ll be Waylon chasing after me, not the other way around. Remember that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn was left speechless. Alexia had truly lost it. Did this girl have any idea how absurd she sounded?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go pamper your fragile son. He must need it,&#34; Alexia quipped, then ended the call right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming on the other end, Evelyn slammed the phone down so hard it rattled the table. Her rage took over,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and she sent a trail of glassware crashing to the floor. The servants hurried in, tripping over themselves as they scrambled to clear the chaos, all unnerved by a tantrum she almost never showed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Somebody better tell Marilee to drag herself back here!&#34; Evelyn barked. &#34;All she does is stir up trouble for her brother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia returned to her screen, where a flood of new notifications filled her feed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her audience shot past half a million in what felt like a blink, and the numbers just kept ticking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brand offers began pouring into her messages, all hoping to get a piece of the action with deals and partnerships. She turned every one of them down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The charts topping every social site told the same story-the fake daughter fiasco and Zayne&#39;s doctored credentials had gone viral. While Alexia set the first spark, even she never pictured the wildfire reaching this far or burning this fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A notification lit up her phone. Ada was sending message after message, barely giving her time to reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I caught your live. You totally killed it! Alexia, your knack for drama is wild. You broke the internet tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guess what? Carrie lost her mind after your stream and went off at her folks. She&#39;s already saying she&#39;ll call off the engagement. Sounds like she never cared much for Zayne anyway. Now she&#39;s got a perfect reason to walk away. If she does, that&#39;s the end for the Jenkins family-trouble inside and out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia smirked as she responded, &#34;Things aren&#39;t so cut-and-dried. Families like that don&#39;t drop engagements over just one video.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost instantly, Ada replied, &#34;Maybe, but Carrie&#39;s stubborn to the core. Anything can happen. But hey-what&#39;s up with the Jenkins family talking about lawsuits? Are you really taking this to court?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re bluffing. All threats, no follow-through. Even if they try, it&#39;ll crash and burn before it gets anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could pinpoint exactly where the Jenkins family was most vulnerable-Zayne&#39;s shaky public image. If she dragged him into the spotlight, they&#39;d spend all their energy trying to mop up his mess, not chasing after her in court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And who didn&#39;t know how to make threats? The Jenkins family was loud but harmless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they&#39;d truly had what it took, they wouldn&#39;t still be stumbling through life, barely keeping their heads above water, even after all the years she&#39;d spent quietly laying out a path for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back-and-forth messages buzzed between Alexia and Ada while chaos brewed for the Jenkins family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, Zayne and his crew pleaded with social media teams to make the trending stories vanish, but they heard the same thing Marilee did-no chance. The pushback from up top was too strong. Nobody dared step in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to drown out the noise, they unleashed armies of bots across the web, but their rivals had already called in their own digital reinforcements, clogging the feeds even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the biggest threat didn&#39;t come from behind-the-scenes tactics. Regular people lined up behind Alexia,turning the tide on their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside his office, Zayne pressed his fingers to his aching temples, fighting off a pounding headache.But Alexia&#39;s words from the livestream wouldn&#39;t stop echoing in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t even qualify to take the same entrance exam as me.&#34;</p>
