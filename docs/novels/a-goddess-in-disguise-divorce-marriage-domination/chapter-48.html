            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Stepping into Alexia&#39;s new place, Ada looked around with surprise. &#34;Impressive spot! Sunlight pours in, the view is gorgeous, and I have to say-your sense of style shines through. Shame it&#39;s not a little bigger,though!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Handing over a glass of wine, Alexia smiled. &#34;This is perfect for one person. More space would only echo with emptiness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking a sip, Ada shrugged. &#34;You know, if you&#39;re ever craving company, just bring a man around.They&#39;re good for something,right? People are saying you and Waylon have something going on. I honestly thought his invite to that gala was just a setup, but clearly, I was off the mark. Word is Roger embarrassed himself at the auction. Had I known, I&#39;d have begged my brother to get me a ticket. What a scene l missed!&#34;She gave her thigh a playful smack, the regret plain in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calmly, Alexia lifted her glass and took a sip. &#34;Roger had it coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That comment brought out a mischievous glint in  Ada&#39;s eye. &#34;Still, wasn&#39;t it Waylon who gave him trouble? Did you ever corner Waylon about why he came to your rescue? Is he really interested in you,or is that just talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Alexia&#39;s thoughts flickered to Waylon&#39;s unadorned hand. &#34;Why would he look my way? Even if he did, it wouldn&#39;t be in any romantic sense. I actually asked him, you know. He told me he was just doing his good deed for the day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Ada nearly choked on her wine, eyes wide with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile tugged at Alexia&#39;s lips as she passed over a tissue. &#34;The answer&#39;s plain as day. He spotted my struggles and stepped in like some Good Samaritan. Might as well call him the neighborhood&#39;s patron saint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada, deflated by her friend&#39;s indifference, shook her head and said, &#34;Waylon&#39;s in a league of his own. If anyone manages to land him, I&#39;ll be seriously impressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a sharp knock echoed from the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Answering the knock, Alexia found a young girl wearing bear pajamnas, cheeks flushed. &#34;Um, excuse me! My cat took a flying leap off my balcony.I think it might have ended up on yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both women hurried outside to investigate. There on the balcony, a frail-looking cat lay still, one leg at an odd angle. Blood had pooled beneath it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Alexia scooped up the injured animal. Ada&#39;s voice rose in alarm. &#34;That&#39;s awful! We need to rush it to the vet right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wringing her hands, the little girl pleaded, &#34;Could you please help me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her request hung in the air as a harsh call sliced through the moment. &#34;Betsey! Where on earth have you gone this time? You&#39;re nothing but trouble!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear flashed across the child&#39;s face. She shrank back,glancing nervously toward the doorway, where a stern -looking middle-aged woman had appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman swept into the room, face twisted in anger. &#34;So this is where you&#39;ve been hiding!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reacting instantly, Betsey Adams slipped behind Alexia for protection. Ada, catching the storm brewing in the woman&#39;s eyes, retorted, &#34;Are you her grandmother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of irritation crossed the woman&#39;s face.I&#39;m the nanny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re the nanny? You sure act like you&#39;re her grandmother.&#34; Ada&#39;s gaze traveled up and down the woman, her voice dripping with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing Ada wasn&#39;t someone to cross, the woman&#39;s bravado faded. Instead, she settled for shooting daggers at Betsey. &#34;Get over here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tiny, wavering voice came from Betsey. &#34;| just wanted them to help take thekitten to see a doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick look at the injured cat in Alexia&#39;s arms drew nothing but a cold smirk from the woman. &#34;Still fussing over that ragged little creature, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgust sharpened her tone. &#34;You&#39;re seven, aren&#39;t you?Shouldn&#39;t you know better by now? All you ever do is make trouble for your mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That struck a nerve with Alexia. Her eyebrows drew together as she scoffed, &#34;Is that really the way you speak to a child? At your age, I&#39;d expect you to know basic decency.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush crept up the woman&#39;s neck. &#34;You&#39;ve got a lot of nerve, talking back to me. Whatever&#39;s going on here, it&#39;s none of your business. Family matters don&#39;t need outsiders meddling!&#34; 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, she lunged for Betsey&#39;s ear. &#34;How many times do I have to call you? Are you pretending not to hear me?&#34;</p>
