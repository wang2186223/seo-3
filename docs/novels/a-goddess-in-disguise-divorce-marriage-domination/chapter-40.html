                <p>In a surprising move, Roger shot his paddle into the air. &#34;Six hundred million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock rippled through the audience, jaws dropping all around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement that had just filled the hall instantly evaporated, replaced by a hush so heavy it felt unnatural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speculation darted from face to face-nobody could figure out what possessed Roger to act like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why compete with Waylon now, after giving up the Adam&#39;s Heart? Was it truly about Marilee, or something more?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of attention pressed in on Marilee, and heat crept up her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one else realized that Roger&#39;s battle with Waylon wasn&#39;t about her at all. At its core, this was for the artist, Sirius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger paid no mind to the whispers or gaping stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This entire evening had left him simmering. Losing ground to Waylon-whether in business or over the coveted crown-gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when it came to Sirius, his resolve was unshakeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One look from Roger told Waylon everything he needed to know. Recognizing that possessive glare,Waylon let a wry smile touch his lips and murmured something to the attendant. Moments later, the attendant stepped confidently onto the auction platform.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright smile spread across the attendant&#39;s face as she addressed the crowd. &#34;For the painting of Sirius,Mr. Mason guarantees to top any offer by an additional three hundred million. Please, the bidding continues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s unwavering intent became unmistakable with that single statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of murmurs swept through the room,leaving all eyes and pressure trained on Roger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every bidder in attendance had already passed strict financial screening before being allowed in. Whether playing with their fortunes or chasing after a dream,there were hard limits here. Anyone who bid beyond their verified means would be disqualified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon had the luxury of limitless play, but Roger risked exposing his own vulnerability by pushing any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Gibson fortune simply didn&#39;t mneasure up to the Mason family&#39;s might.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With furrowed brows, Alexia regarded Waylon,graveness settling in her features. &#34;Are you actually serious about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick nod from Waylon followed. &#34;When it comes to money, I never joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia, unconvinced, asked, &#34;So, Sirius matters to you that much? Or is this just about proving a point?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon replied, &#34;Why does it matter? I get what l want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing about his self-assurance surprised Alexia anymore. Her eyes drifted to Roger, reading the tension in his posture without letting her feelings show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not so long ago, she would have bent over backward just to see Roger&#39;s wishes granted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the person she used to be felt distant, almost unrecognizable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee&#39;s voice trembled with concern. &#34;Roger...&#34; For the first time, she questioned whether she truly understood him. She always believed she could influence him, but the night&#39;s auction revealed a reckless, unfamiliar side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was ready to sacrifice everything for a woman he&#39;d never even met. The Adam&#39;s Heart-a prize Marilee herself had coveted-meant little to him compared to this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of worry clouded Marilee&#39;s eyes, though she managed to keep her voice gentle. &#34;Let&#39;s not push this any further. If your grandfather hears about tonight, you know he&#39;ll explode. Waylon has made it clear-he&#39;s determined to own that painting.Challenging him here... what would that mean for the Gibson family&#39;s future?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found it hard to believe Roger could be this blind to their predicament, unless his obsession with Sirius had truly consumed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her caution hit Roger with the weight of truth. He cast a sidelong glance at Waylon and responded with a bitter, hollow laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only men knew what it took to break another man&#39;s spirit. Waylon wielded his wealth and status like a weapon,smothering his pride for all to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anything he set his sights on, Waylon snatched away with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence settled across the hall as the auctioneer began the final countdown. When Roger didn&#39;t so much as flinch, the crowd shot each other looks of understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how stubborn he was, even Roger had his limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the gavel broke the tension, and with that, the painting belonged to Waylon-at the price of nine hundred million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one gasped, no one cried out, but a quiet ripple of conversation circled the room, eyes drifting back to Roger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he really just walk away from it all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What choice did he really have? Refusing to back down would&#39;ve forced Allen to apologize in person tomorrow. The poor old man shouldn&#39;t have to deal with messes like this at his age.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did Roger even think he could challenge Waylon? Now he&#39;s trapped, and everyone&#39;s watching -what a mess for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s always about chasing after a woman, isn&#39;t it? In the end, Waylon&#39;s just better at this game. Men trying to outdo one another only end up looking ridiculous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word, tinged with derision, pressed heavily on Roger&#39;s mood. His expression grew darker by the second, a deep resentment for Alexia flooding in,washing away any last trace of regret he&#39;d felt for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, if she hadn&#39;t butted heads with him,Waylon would&#39;ve stayed out of it, and he wouldn&#39;t be the joke of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes fixed on Alexia&#39;s retreating figure, bitterness twisted his features. &#34;She&#39;s nothing but trouble.&#34;</p>
