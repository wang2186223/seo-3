                <p>Marilee had just wrapped up her work when her phone suddenly rang. It was Evelyn calling,demanding that she come home immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second she entered the house, Marilee spotted her mother in the living room. Evelyn&#39;s expression left no doubt that she was furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy knot formed in Marilee&#39;s stomach. &#34;Mom,why did you want me to come back so urgently?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn sneered, &#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious? Eleanor stormed in here and tore into us, saying we&#39;d raised a foolish,careless daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You all know?&#34; Marilee blurted out, scrambling to explain herself. &#34;Mom, I never meant for things to spiral like this. The Black Tiger Gang...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Marilee could explain further, Evelyn silenced her with a swift gesture. Rising from the couch, she marched right up to Marilee and, without warning,slapped her hard across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound echoed through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staggered, Marilee stared at her mother, disbelief and tears filling her eyes. &#34;Mom...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn could barely contain her frustration. &#34;How many times do I need to remind you? Your choices reflect on everyone in the Jenkins family, not just yourself! If you weren&#39;t certain about the plan to take Alexia, why did you stick with it? Do you realize how much leverage the Gibson family has over us now? If word gets out, your future&#39;s on the line, and so is the reputation of the Lady Cat brand, and even Jenkins Group&#39;s stock is at risk. Haven&#39;t you noticed our stocks dropping? Are you really trying to make things even worse for us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the final straw. Feeling utterly wronged,Marilee lost control. She tossed her bag onto the floor, voice trembling with anger. &#34;How much more do you expect me to take? I hate Alexia. Are you ever going to stand up for me? You kept me in someone else&#39;s home when I was little. I had to chase after Alexia in everything, even matching her test scores because you insisted on it. After every exam, you&#39;d send me her grades to remind me how far behind l was. Alexia is all you care about. I&#39;ve never been good enough for you, not even when I was a kid!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn&#39;s patience snapped, her finger stabbing the air in accusation. &#34;What nonsense are you spouting now? How many times do I have to remind you that Alexia was only a walking blood supply for you.I made it clear-once you recovered, you&#39;d come home. Have you ever been denied anything you wanted? Did you ever go without? Alexia never even had a fraction of your allowance. When you dreamed of becoming an actress, I moved mountains to get you into show business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee, on the verge of breaking, screamed back,&#34;So what would&#39;ve happened if I never got better?Would Alexia get to keep my spot as your daughter forever? You brought her in because I was sick,just so nobody would whisper about our family. I never asked to be sick! Mom, didn&#39;t you know why l&#39;d be sick in the first place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn&#39;s hand shot out, cutting her off with another harsh slap. &#34;Enough! Not another word!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain from that blow wasn&#39;t just on Marilee&#39;s cheek. It tore right through her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment heavy in her voice, Evelyn went on,&#34;Why did I get stuck with such a foolish child? You have no sense of priorities. You let your feelings dictate every move and never think about the consequences. This mess you started, you&#39;re going to fix it. Listen closely. You&#39;re done with Roger. I don&#39;t want to hear his name again. I&#39;ve arranged for you to meet the heir to the Brooks family. The introduction is set for next Saturday, and you will be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streaming down her face, Marilee stood her ground. &#34;I&#39;m not walking away from Roger. He&#39;s the only one who&#39;s ever really cared about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn let out a low chuckle. &#34;I know you&#39;re just lashing out because you&#39;re upset. But let&#39;s be honest, the Gibson famnily isn&#39;t what they used to be.If you tie yourself to Roger, you&#39;ll end up miserable.You&#39;ve always thrived on luxury and everyone&#39;s admiration. Are you truly prepared to throw all that away for a man Alexia cast aside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold wave swept over Marilee, leaving her stunned by her mother&#39;s ruthless words. &#34;But you promised could be with Roger. That&#39;s what you told me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn simply turned her back, folding her arms with an air of indifference. &#34;All I ever wanted was for you to keep Roger on a string, to make Alexia jealous and humiliated. I never expected you to actually fall for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee&#39;s fingers dug into the fabric of her dress,her knuckles turning white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that their marriage is over, you have no reason to hang on to Roger. He was just a convenient pawn.As a Jenkins, you should be aiming higher, planning for your future. I want more for you than what Alexia has, so much more. The Brooks family is new money,but their influence is growing by the day. I&#39;ve worked  hard to set up this introduction. Don&#39;t throw it away.If you miss this chance, you&#39;ll spend your whole life stuck in Alexia&#39;s shadow!&#34;</p>
