                <p>The sharp voice made Brandon lift his head suddenly, his hands curling into tight fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had the guts to show up again. If she hadn&#39;t seduced Waylon, he wouldn&#39;t be in this disaster now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger looked up and saw Alexia step in, the light behind her outlining her figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since the divorce talk, she seemed to shine more each time he saw her. There was something different about her-stronger, sharper. Roger found himself watching her, unable to look away, which had never happened in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And truth be told, he hated how his feelings had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia had slapped him three times in the courthouse, yet the only thing stuck in his mind afterward was the look in her eyes-hurt and furious.He couildn&#39;t get that out of his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria quickly got up and stepped protectively in front of Brandon. &#34;Alexia, what do you want?&#34; she demanded, her tone sharp and defensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia gave a cold smile. &#34;I came to deal with Roger and Brandon.&#34; She threw a glance at Roger. &#34;Where&#39;s Marilee? Isn&#39;t she usually glued to your side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger avoided her eyes. &#34;Marilee had things to do.Not everyone is as free as you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, Eleanor had told him not to bring Marilee home. He didn&#39;t want to risk upsetting his grandmother, sohe didn&#39;t argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eleanor saw Alexia, her usual cold face softened a little. She waved kindly. &#34;Come sit,Alexia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia replied calmly, &#34;Thanks, but I&#39;ll stand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor looked a bit let down by her answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon shoved Gloria aside and stormed toward her. &#34;You&#39;ve got some nerve showing up! I swear, I&#39;ll make you pay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could get any closer, Roger stepped in and blocked him. &#34;What the hell are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon, now even angrier, glared at Roger. &#34;I should be asking you! Why are you stopping me from giving her what she deserves?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger let out an annoyed sigh. &#34;If anything happens to her, you&#39;ll lose your remaining fingers too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t support the idea of Allen going after Waylon for answers either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brandon got kidnapped, Waylon had given Roger the heads-up to rescue him. If Waylon really meant harm, he wouldn&#39;t have sent any warning at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of Brandon and Alexia were kidnapped. If Brandon hadn&#39;t sold Alexia out and messed everything up, Roger could&#39;ve flipped the situation and pressured the Black Tiger Gang to wipe Brandon&#39;s debt clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But sadly, Brandon was more of a burden than help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon let out a mocking laugh. &#34;You&#39;re scared-even in our own territory! I thought you had guts,Roger. Clearly, I was wrong!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia smirked coldly. &#34;Why so worked up, Brandon?Didn&#39;t losing two fingers knock some sense into you?Maybe Waylon should&#39;ve cut off all of your fingers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa, are you hearing this? How can she talk like that?&#34; Brandon exploded with rage. &#34;She ruined me,and she still dares to mock me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough!&#34; Allen tapped his cane hard on the floor, his tone tight with control as he looked at Alexia.&#34;Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s voice dripped with sarcasm. &#34;I came to talk about the divorce terms. Roger wants to kick me out with nothing. Everyone says your family&#39;s known for being generous, but I guess that generosity doesn&#39;t extend to the women you cast aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Roger&#39;s leaving you wwith nothing?&#34; Eleanor&#39;s fury surged, her finger trembling as she pointed at Roger. &#34;Is this how you treat her? What about all those promises you made?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s expression turned cold. &#34;She signed the prenup herself. She wasn&#39;t supposed to get much from the start. And now that she has Waylon backing her, she doesn&#39;t need a dime from me. Sure, I cheated, but she&#39;s no saint either. I don&#39;t plan on giving her a cent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria added with a scoff, &#34;Yeah, like you actually need the money. That outfit alone probably costs tens of thousands-it&#39;s a limited edition from some luxury brand. It looks to me like you&#39;re living quite comfortably. So why go after my son&#39;s money? lf you&#39;re strapped for cash, just hit up Waylon. Or are you saving up in case he dumps you one day and you end up with nothing? That would be a smart move-very clever of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria had always had a sharp tongue. From the day Alexia married into the family, she became Gloria&#39;s favorite target-someone to mock and nitpick at every chance. While Gloria basked in the surface-level respect Alexia showed her as an elder, deep down, she never truly wished Alexia well.</p>
