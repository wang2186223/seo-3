            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Alexia raised an eyebrow. &#34;Wait, you came to find me? Don&#39;t tell me you actually enrolled in my class?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan nodded without a second thought. &#34;Wouldn&#39;t miss it for anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled. &#34;It&#39;s really not that exciting. Just a basic course to help students get their credits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t matter,&#34; he said with a small smile. &#34;Still wanted to be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stood nearby, silently fuming as they talked like he wasn&#39;t even present. &#34;Nolan, have you completely lost it?&#34; he asked, sounding annoyed and confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t even look at him properly. &#34;If you&#39;re confused, start by asking yourself why you think it&#39;s okay to mouth off to a faculty member. You think that&#39;s going to end well for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, turning back to Alexia, he added, &#34;Ignore him. He&#39;s all muscle, no mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s face turned red with shame. He couldn&#39;t stand smart guys like Nolan, who always made him feel small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut your mouth, jerk!&#34; he snapped, throwing his basketball aside and charging at Nolan. But Nolan moved like lightning. His eyes sharpened, and in one quick motion, he swept his leg behind Brandon&#39;s knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a loud thud, Brandon hit the floor. The noise was enough to turn heads-students nearby stopped to see what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t bat an eye, even with all the stares on him. &#34;If that hurt your pride, file a complaint. Or go cry to your grandfather again-those seem to be your two go-to moves. Honestly, you act like a spoiled kid who never grew up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said it so calmly, but every word hit Brandon&#39;s pride like aknife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of whispers and stifled laughs spread through the students watching. Brandon, humiliated,scrambled up and growled, &#34;You&#39;ll regret this!&#34; before darting off like he couldn&#39;t get away fast enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia raised an eyebrow, slightly amused. &#34;Huh. Didn&#39;t know he could run that fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan shrugged like it was nothing. &#34;Huh, that was light punishment for someone who can&#39;t grasp common respect. Come on, I&#39;Il walk you to your lecture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia nodded and walked alongside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they arrived at the lecture room, students were already starting to take their seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her first time teaching this class, and Alexia made sure to be fully ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, whispers followed her into the lecture room. The scandal about the &#34;fake daughter&#34; was clearly the hot topic. She even noticed a few students trying to secretly take pictures of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexia stayed unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the lecture started, the room calmed down. Alexia took control with ease, skipping the usual boring style in favor of simple, relatable teaching that made tough topics easier to grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The students gradually stopped zoning out. Their blank stares turned into interest as her lesson drew them in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midway through class, Alexia brought up some exciting new developments in gene editing and how they were now being used in cancer treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A student quickly raised his hand. Alexia looked over and saw a young man with glasses, tidy clothes, and a respectful demeanor. &#34;Yes?&#34; she prompted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke in a calm, thoughtful tone. &#34;Since gene editing has shown such strong results in clinical trials, it seems like the field has a bright future. So with that in mind, do you think ethical restrictions might loosen up? More specifically, should editing human embryos to remove inherited diseases be allowed at some point?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His question stirred instant whispers across the room. Even Nolan leaned forward slightly, clearly curious to hear Alexia&#39;s answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia calmly shut her textbook. &#34;It really depends on the situation. If we start loosening ethical limits around gene editing in human embryos, we open the door to things like &#39;designer babies.&#39; And let&#39;s not forget-cutting-edge technology always comes at a cost. If parents could design their children&#39;s looks, IQ,or talents... who&#39;s really getting access to that? The wealthy. And what kind of world does that build?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The student paused, thinking it over. &#34;It&#39;d probably make social inequality worse and maybe reduce diversity too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia gave a faint smile. &#34;Exactly. Tech pushes us forward, but it&#39;s not all upside. People are complex,and because of that, there&#39;s always going to be conflict. And that tension? It&#39;s what keeps innovation alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused for a beat, her voice tightening. &#34;But if the wealthy start perfecting their children from birth through gene editing, that tension will vanish fast and not in a good way. Ethics exist to protect those who don&#39;t have power. Without those boundaries, we&#39;re not evolving-we&#39;re wiping out options for millions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The student let out a slow sigh. &#34;But doesn&#39;t that slow down science? And honestly, why keep protecting the weak? Isn&#39;t survival of the fittest how nature works? Shouldn&#39;t the weak just be phased out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words hit like a brick. The room, buzzing just moments ago, went completely still. Everyone turned to look at him, their faces full of shock and disbelief.</p>
