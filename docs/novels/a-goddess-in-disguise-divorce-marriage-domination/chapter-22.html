                <p>&#34;Roger&#39;s a complete fool.&#34; Alexia spoke with an icy calm, but a hint of irritation slipped through. &#34;I&#39;ve begged for that divorce a hundred times. He dodges my calls, ignores every message... He could just disappear for all I care. It&#39;d save everyone a headache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strangely enough, fate seemed to listen. That same night, Roger got into a car wreck. He was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic swept through the Gibson family. Even the old patriarch, Allen, fighting through aching joints and stubborn pride, found himself hobbling into the hospital long after midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee showed up not long after, conveniently crossing paths with the family. She wasted no time putting on a display of heartfelt concern, flitting around like she couldn&#39;t bear to leave Roger&#39;s side Watching from the sidelines, Gloria leaned closer to Allen and murmured, &#34;Marilee&#39;s a lovely girl-polite,no drama, and her career&#39;s taking off. Since Roger&#39;s interested in her, why not give them your blessing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen slammed his cane on the floor, clearly irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s what&#39;s on your mind right now? There are bigger issues. Has anyone figured out how this crash happened? He was driving a brand-new Rolls-Royce,top of the line. How does a luxury car lose control,blow a tire, and slam into a guardrail? That doesn&#39;t just happen by chance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria&#39;s expression turned serious. &#34;We&#39;ve already got people digging intoit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the family speculated, Marilee nervously paced the hospital corridor. Eventually, she took out her phone and called her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, something&#39;s happened to Roger. The injuries Look bad. He probably won&#39;t be able to show up for the Chamber of Commerce&#39;s gala this weekend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy pause hung in the air before Evelyn finally replied, voice calm and measured, &#34;Forget the gala Clear your schedule and stay with him. That&#39;s your only job now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom!&#34; Marilee blurted out, frustration edging her tone, before quickly lowering her voice so others wouldn&#39;t overhear. &#34;There are nurses watching him every second. He doesn&#39;t need me hanging around.I&#39;ve barely rejoined the family, and if I don&#39;t go to that gala, no one will even remember | exist!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having grown up in another household, she had  always felt like an outsider since coming back, never quite fitting in with the city&#39;s elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Jenkins family might wield power, but one name alone couldn&#39;t open every door in those social circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More and more, Marilee sensed invisible barriers hemming her in at every turn. That gala wasn&#39;t just another party; it might be the only way to finally get noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn&#39;s tone stayed soft, almost soothing. &#34;This isn&#39;t some weekend charity ball. Only the top of the top get invited. The Jenkins family was given a single invitation-your brother will be representing us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee pressed her lips together, fighting back disappointment. &#34;Isn&#39;t there any way he can give me his spot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cod pause followed, then Evelyn let out a short,humorless laugh. &#34;You can&#39;t be serious. I&#39;ve already done more than enough for you. From the beginning,I was against you and Roger. I worked nonstop to get Alexia paired off with him so you wouldn&#39;t waste your future.I warned you-set your sights higher. You&#39;re my only daughter; you should marry into one of the city&#39;s four major families, not cling to someone as useless as Roger. But you didn&#39;t listen. You fell for him before you even understood the consequences. Do you have any idea how much you&#39;ve jeopardized your chances for a good marriage? And now you&#39;re still hung up on Alexia&#39;s ex?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee protested &#34;But I love Roger-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn cut her off coldly. &#34;If you truly loved him, you wouldn&#39;t be begging me for a way into the gala. You&#39;d be by his side right now, and that would be enough.But if you really want to move up in this world, you&#39;ll have to leave Roger. Otherwise, you&#39;re on your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that, the call dropped without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee stood in the harsh fluorescent light of the hospital hallway, clutching her phone, resentment flickering behind her downcast eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So be it. If no one was willing to lend a hand,she would carve out her own path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hidden within Afoross&#39; most iconic district, the Orchid Estate belonged solely to Waylon. The property stood as a symbol of prestige, blending elegant design with unmatched convenience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Waylon lounged alone in his study,lost in the pages of a book. A Siamese cat with striking blue eyes weaved between his feet, demanding attention. At first, Waylon paid no mind, but the cat persisted,nuzzling against his leg with growing determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually,Waylon gave in, setting the book aside to lift the insistent feline into his lap. As he stroked its fur, the cat settled comfortably, purring in contentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle knock broke the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; Waylon called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon Lyons, Waylon&#39;s assistant, entered the room.&#34;Sir, everything went as you directed. He&#39;s still alive-barely,but alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cat shifted in Waylon&#39;s arms, blinking up at Simon and letting out a soft meow. Waylon offered a distracted nod, then spoke with a casual air. &#34;Send an invitation to the Braxton family for the Chamber of Commerce&#39;s gala.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon hesitated. &#34;The Braxton family? After their falling-out with the Gibson family,they lost nearly everything. They&#39;re barely scraping by, and rumor has it, they&#39;re planning to leave Afoross for good.If they do turn up at the gala, it&#39;s unlikely they&#39;ll get a warm reception.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s gaze flickered upward, cool and unwav/ering &#34;Leaving Afoross? Did I give them permission to leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon fell silent,uncertain. Waylon leaned back, voice light yet chilling. &#34;Hand the invitation to Matteo Braxton personally. Whether the Braxton family makes it through this or not-that&#39;ll be up to him.&#34;</p>
