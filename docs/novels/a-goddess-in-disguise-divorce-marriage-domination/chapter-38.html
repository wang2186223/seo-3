                <p>Chapter of her life. Though always proud, she&#39;d found herself suffocating in the mess of a crumbling marriage and family duties. Each day chipped away at her until she barely recognized herself anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The painting wasn&#39;t just art-it was a scream, a raw eruption of every injustice she&#39;d swallowed. A need to rip apart everything that had broken her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee sat among the murmurs, rolling her eyes internally at the praise. She never liked these so-called prodigies. &#34;What&#39;s so amazing about Sirius way? Looks like she&#39;s just doing it for attention.Don&#39;t youI think so, Roger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to him with a light smile, expecting agreement, but froze. His entire expression had shifted. The gloom was gone. He was now staring at the painting on stage with a sharp focus and a spark in his eyes she had never seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s her...&#34; Roger whispered in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee&#39;s smile faltered. A faint unease crept in.&#34;Roger, do you know her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a slow nod, then shook his head,almost mocking himself. &#34;I did once. I had the chance, but l ruined it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when he was taken in by the Gibson family,Roger had carried the weight of his humble past like a curse. Surrounded by judgment, he assumed the world saw him as less, and so, he returned the sentiment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen never eased up on him. The rules were rigid, the pressure suffocating. Roger had turned to boxing as an escape, something he could control. After putting in a lot of effort, he finally got into competitions, but he kept losing. There was even a time he got beaten so badly his face was left bruised and swollen. It was only when he was completely pushed to his limits that he managed to win a match or two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered those days all too well-walking into school bruised and disheveled, only to see Waylon&#39;s name gleaming on every honor board. He was always surrounded and admired by students and staff alike.Compared to Waylon, everyone else seemed to vanish into the background.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had felt brutally unfair. Some people didn&#39;t need to try-they just were, and the world couldn&#39;t help but be drawn to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen, bitter over Waylon&#39;s success, pushed Roger endlessly. If he wasn&#39;t berating, he was mocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boxing? What a joke! You should be hitting the books instead! Waylon&#39;s score is miles ahead of yours. I brought in top-tier tutors for you, and this is how you thank me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler tried to calm Allen. &#34;Please calm down,Mr. Gibson. Roger is already quite intelligent, but Waylon has always been something else. A born genius...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So others can be geniuses, but not Roger? Look at him! Can&#39;t even win a fight. What use is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounded by sneers and criticism, Roger had no choice but to silently close the door and throw himself back into training.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He first crossed paths with Sirius during an early elimination match. That day, everything felt off-his body was sluggish, his mind filled with doubt. Every hit he took seemed to echo with Allen&#39;s biting ridicule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By halftime, he was exhausted-physically and mentally. He shuffled toward his coach, tempted to call it quits, when a girl suddenly appeared and handed him a sketchbook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, you&#39;re Roger, right? Someone wanted you to have this,&#34; she said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took it without much thought, but the moment he flipped it open, his breath caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Page after page held rough yet vivid drawings of him.His form captured in various matches-win or lose,battered or proud-each sketch held something more than lines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter the outcome-victorious or defeated,bloodied or determined-she had drawn him like a hero, as though he were the centerpiece of his own story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the very end, a single name was scribbledd: Sirius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, the name meant nothing to him. The girl explained, &#34;Sirius had to leave early and couldn&#39;t stay to watch the rest of your match. But she asked me to pass this on to you-life is like a game. There are no forever winners or losers. If y/ou give your all every time, you&#39;ve already won. Keep giving it your best in the matches ahead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking back, it wasn&#39;t dramatic to say-she was his salvation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like being pulled from the depths just as he was about to drown-her words, that sketchbook, gave him the air he desperately needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped back into the ring as if something had changed. It was like victory herself had taken his side. That round, he fought like a man reborn and won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t long before he discovered the truth that Sirius was no ordinary girl. She was a rising star in the art world, already famous by the time they met.The first time he ever walked into an art gallery was for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he walked into the gallery, his footsteps stopped in front of a massive painting.Around him,people whispered in awe about how much it had sold for-an outrageous sum.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But none of that mattered. The moment he looked at the canvas, every other sound disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never met Sirius before, and he didn&#39;t know the first thing about art, but standing there, he felt it deep in his gut-Sirius was born for this. She belonged to the world of art, a world full of brilliance and creativity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was part of that rare group of geniuses, and someone like him could never truly reach her.</p>
