            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Nothing left a deeper scar than words that cut right through to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night after night, the sting of the International Math Competition never left Zayne alone. It lingered in the shadows, creeping into his thoughts when sleep refused to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could still remember the day Alexia joined the family and enrolled at his school. That was when he first realized what it meant to share his world with someone who made brilliance look effortless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All his life, he had been called gifted, especially in numbers. Teachers singled him out. He enjoyed being at the top. Then Alexia stepped into the spotlight. Watching her in action, the self-assurance he once felt drained away, replaced by a quiet, gnawing doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being the Jenkins family&#39;s firstborn was supposed to mean leading the way. Instead, next to Alexia&#39;s talent,he shrank back, unsure if he would ever truly belong in the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only the family&#39;s expectations had landed elsewhere...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Alexia hadn&#39;t chosen to step aside, turning her back on elite universities, marrying early and becoming a housewife...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He probably wouldn&#39;t be sitting in that chair right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Zayne was lost in those thoughts, his phone rang. His mother was calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t bother with the gossip online, Zayne. It&#39;s nothing. I&#39;ll make sure Alexia pays for this. You have my word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, uncertain, and finally changed the subject. &#34;Mom, what made you pick me? When the family had to pick an heir, why was it me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dismissive laugh, Evelyn barely hesitated. &#34;Why? Because you&#39;re my son. Who else would I choose to take over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Travis? He&#39;s your son too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s just not up to the task. And Alexia? Even worse. Just look at her now-she&#39;s nothing but trouble. If we&#39;d handed her the reins, she&#39;d have swept everything away before we even knew it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zayne wasn&#39;t convinced. &#34;But Alexia has always outshined me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough. Don&#39;t let foolish ideas distract you. Whether you like it or not, you&#39;re the head of this family now.You can&#39;t falter, not for a second. As for Alexia, she sealed her own fate the day she married Roger. Nobody expects a divorced woman to recover from that, not with her reputation. You have nothing to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if she managed to rise again? The thought ran laps in his head, yet Zayne swallowed the words,unable to give them life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time after time, his mother had brushed Alexia aside. She spent years planting the idea that Alexia was finished, locked in a loveless marriage with no real future orinfluence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, ever since the divorce, support had started to gather around Alexia. Instead of fading into the background, she was turning into a force that nobody could brush aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a quiet breath, Zayne treaded carefully into a new topic. &#34;After the livestream, Carrie insists on ending the engagement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She can wish all she wants. The Kennedy name doesn&#39;t give her the freedom to play games. This engagement is about business, not romance. Her father wouldn&#39;t dare risk it.&#34; Resentment flared in Evelyn&#39;s chest. &#34;So Alexia wants to stir up trouble, does she? Let her do her worst. You stay focused on the company.I&#39;ll deal with everything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, Zayne saw Travis leaning against the doorframe, arms folded, a lazy grin plastered on his face as if he&#39;d been standing there forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a look that could curdle milk, Zayne demanded,&#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just here to visit the star of the shnow. You&#39;re all over the internet. Didn&#39;t you hear? You&#39;re basically a household name.&#34; Travis wandered in, flopped down on the office couch, and produced a cigarette with the air of someone who owned the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the provocation, Zayne demanded, &#34;Not in my office.Put it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Travis lit up anyway and exhaled a ribbon of smoke as if Zayne hadn&#39;t spoken at all. &#34;Perks of being the CEO -making up your own.rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With eyes like storm clouds, Zayne responded, &#34;If you&#39;re so bored, I&#39;ll send you to one of our remote sites.You could use something to keep you busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And end up stuck in the middle of nowhere, with no signal and nothing but dust? Pass.&#34; Travis let out a laugh. &#34;Let me ask you something. Was all that fuss about getting into that fancy university really about ambition? Or was it simply because it was Alexia&#39;s dream university?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of anger flashed in Zayne&#39;s eyes. &#34;You&#39;re talking nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, Travis searched for an ashtray, then crushed the cigarette out in the trash. &#34;Touchy,huh?You tanked that deal with Goldrose Consortium. Dad&#39;s been fuming ever since. Guess who he shipped off to clean up your disaster? Me. Had me flying all over the globe for new partners. Don&#39;t you think you owe me for that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zayne kept his tone cold. &#34;Dad&#39;s giving you a shot. You ought to be grateful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Travis&#39;s laughter rolled out, low and full of irony.&#34;Grateful? He promised me the whole overseas branch if l land this contract, and even dangled that ten percent stake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words seemed to catch Zayne off guard, his face stilling for a moment before he found his footing.&#34;Then you&#39;d better not disappoint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t. By the way, remind me to send Luna a thank-you card. As long as she&#39;s not on your side, she&#39;s practically my good luck charm.&#34; Travis grinned wickedly. &#34;Look on the bright side. Mom&#39;s still got your back, fixing all your screw-ups. Must be nice, being her favorite.&#34;</p>
