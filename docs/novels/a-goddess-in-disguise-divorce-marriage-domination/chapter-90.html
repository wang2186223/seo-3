                <p>The second those words left Alexia&#39;s lips, the entire room went still-every pair of eyes locked on her in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger was the first to snap. &#34;Have you completely lost it, Alexia?&#34; he barked with fury flaring in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria was seething. &#34;You want my son to walk away with nothing? Do you even hear yourself? After everything he&#39;s worked for, you think you can strip him clean? Keep dreaming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee, though careful not to upset Alexia right now,also thought the demand was ridiculous. Surely Allen and Eleanor wouldn&#39;t actually go along with this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia just gave a casual shrug. &#34;Alright then, see you in court. Good luck making it to next week&#39;s bidding,though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexia began to walk off, Eleanor reached out quickly. &#34;Wait, Alexia! We can still talk. Nothing&#39;s set in stone yet!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s brow furrowed as he growled, &#34;Grandma,did you not hear her? Let her walk away-l&#39;m not agreeing to this madness!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen&#39;s voice rang out sharp and cold. &#34;Enough! Not another word from you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger was caught off guard by the scolding from both grandparents. A sinking feeling began to grow in his chest, warning him that things were about to get worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen&#39;s eyes didn&#39;t waver as he spoke to Alexia. &#34;T&#39;ll give you two-thirds of Roger&#39;s personal assets.That&#39;s the best offer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia slowly tucked a lock of hair behind her ear, her voice calm but firm. &#34;Not enough. I want him to walk out with nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia...&#34; Eleanor&#39;s voice trembled, almost pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Can&#39;t you rethink this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia shook her head lightly, flashing a sugary-sweet smile. &#34;I&#39;ve been more than reasonable. Is Roger&#39;s money really worth gambling the entire Gibson family&#39;s future? If I leak whatI&#39;ve got, it won&#39;t just block your bid-it&#39;ll bring the whole empire crashing down. And trust me, both your grandsons will go down with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was shocked by how calm but cold Alexia sounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like a totally different person-strong and sharp, like a knife ready to cut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger gritted his teeth and snapped, &#34;You don&#39;t have to take everything, Alexia! You&#39;re getting too greedy.Don&#39;t push your luck too far!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia tilted her head, pretending to be confused.&#34;Why are you shouting at me? You should be blaming your brilliant cousin and your equally clueless girlfriend. Oh, and let&#39;s not forget-you cheated on me. Obviously, there&#39;s a price for that. And seriously,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a who turns down more money? If you handed me the whole Gibson family, I&#39;d manage just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That offhanded comment sent a cold shiver through everyone in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching their stunned faces, Alexia broke into a cheerful grin. &#34;Oh, come on. Don&#39;t look so scared.I was just joking. Relax.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria jumped to her feet and pointed at Alexia.&#34;Enough of the games! Just say what you want and stop acting all high and mighty! Don&#39;t make such big demands and waste everyone&#39;s time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia slipped her hand free from Eleanor&#39;s grip and folded her arms with ease. &#34;I&#39;m not playing around.Those are the terms-Roger walks out broke, or we go to war. I&#39;ll start tonight, and one by one, I&#39;ll bring you all down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She threw a bold, deliberate look at Marilee, who instinctively shrank back in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since the live stream scandal, she had realized that Alexia wasn&#39;t someone to be underestimated.When it came to steering public opinion, Alexia was as skilled as any top PR expert. And if her secrets ever got out, Alexia wouldn&#39;t have to lift a finger-her competitors would do the dirty work for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t believe she had been foolish enough to trust Dina. If she could turn back time, she&#39;d have stayed far away from this disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roger...&#34; Marilee whispered, holding onto his sleeve.Her eyes were red and full of tears, and she looked weak and helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Brandon, who had been so arrogant moments ago, lost his composure. He grabbed onto Roger&#39;s leg like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline.&#34;Roger, I&#39;ve already lost two fingers! You didn&#39;t help me last time. Are you really going to stand by again and watch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounded by all the begging and shouting, Roger suddenly felt drained. A heavy tiredness washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room stayed silent for a long timne until Alexia finail lost her patience. &#34;So? Have you decided or not? I&#39;m leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;We&#39;ll accept your terms.&#34; Eleanor&#39;s quiet voice broke the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen didn&#39;t say a word. His silence was as good as agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s voice trembled. &#34;But Grandma...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything he had built-years of effort, every dollar saved, even the wealth handed down from his father -was slipping through his fingers. The ache in his chest was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s voice was calm, but her expression was worn and tired, aged by the weight of the situation.&#34;What choice do we have? Do you want Marilee and Brandon to end up behind bars? We&#39;re old now; our reputations don&#39;t matter anymore. But you still have a future. The Gibson family still means something. As for money, it can always be made again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company was still standing. As long as that remained, there was still hope for a comeback.</p>
