                <p>Patience faded on Marilee&#39;s face as she waited for a reaction, but Alexia wouldn&#39;t even meet her eyes.Instead, she directed her attention to Roger. &#34;Is the Gibson fortune going up in flames? This is all I&#39;m worth?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow crossed Roger&#39;s face. &#34;That&#39;s what the prenup says, so that&#39;s all you&#39;re entitlled to&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even before they got married, he&#39;d clonad avary door to the family&#39;s fortune, making suro she&#39;d nover find a loophole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing Alexia was blatantly ignonng her. Marilee butted in. &#34;You&#39;re getting more than enough, Alexia Wasit love or money you wanted from Roger,anyway?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia still refused to acknowledge her. not so much as a glance. &#34;With an amount this pitiful? Hang on to it-you&#39;ll need every last cent when the Gibson empire falls apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words wiped any patience from Roger&#39;s face.&#34;Don&#39;t push it, Alexia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Marilee&#39;s eyes shimmered with tears and  her voice went brittle, as though her heart might break. &#34;Please, Alexia, don&#39;t do this to Roger,&#34; she whimpered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd&#39;s attention snapped toward her as sobs and sniffles filled the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee reached for the delicate pink diamond at her throat. &#34;Maybe you never knew, but Roger and I have loved each other for years. He gave me this necklace on your wedding day-it&#39;s a symbol of his devotion.That cherry blossom garden in your backyard? Roger built it just for me, hoping I&#39;d smile. You stole my life.Everything you have should have been mine. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time you let go and laft quietly. without asking for more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uncomfortable hush sottled over the room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was rare to see a mistress acting so brazenly,demanding the wife walk away with empty hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,Alexia turned to meet Marilee&#39;s eyes, her voice colder than ice. &#34;I stole your life? Was it me who went to the Jenkins family, begging them to accept me?Was I the one who refused a DNA test and strutted around calling myself their true daughter? Did I chase after Roger, desperate for a marriage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every pointed question shattered the silence,each one sharp enough to cut.All color drained from Marilee&#39;s face, her body rigid beneath Alexia&#39;s icy stare. Not missing a beat, Alexia delivered the final blow. &#34;Go blame your own foolish parents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That snapped the last of Marilee&#39;s restraint. &#34;If it weren&#39;t for them, you&#39;d still be digging through garbage. You&#39;ve been living a luxurious life for twenty years. Without them, you&#39;d be nothing but a pauper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp laugh spilled from Alexia. Her gaze drifted to the faded needle marks on her wrist. &#34;If this is what luxury looks like,I must have missed out. Pain,though?There was always enough of that to go around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disbelief filled Marilee&#39;s oyes. her words trembling with contempt. &#34;Lies. You grew up suoundad by filth -you&#39;re nothing but garbage if my paronts hadn&#39;t stepped in, you&#39;d be gone by now. Some gang would have had its way with you and left you in the gutter-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest never left her mouth. A sharp slap rang out,echoing in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Marilee pressed trembling fingers to the swelling red mark,speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold smile curved Alexia&#39;s lips. &#34;There&#39;s nothing l despise more than people who never learned basic decency.The Jenkins family or not, I&#39;d still be standing here as myself. But you? Without that divorce agreement, you&#39;re nothing more than a shameless mistress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not waiting for a reaction, Alexia hurled the signed divorce agreement straight at Marilee, landing the hit with brutal precision. &#34;Think of it as my parting gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee flinched as the edges nicked her forehead.letting out a startled cry. The shock left her shaking,the color draining from her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia watched the panic unraveling Marilee&#39;s composure, noticing the nervous twitch on her face.Pretending to care, she cocked her head and offered,&#34;Do you need me to call an ambulance for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question broke whatever restraint Marilee had left.&#34;Why would you ever do that?&#34; she snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia gave her a look laced with fake concern.&#34;It just seems like you&#39;re not well at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee&#39;s voice cracked as she screamed, &#34;I am not sick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Roger turned, uncertain and uneasy as her shrill denial filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, Alexia let her reply drip with venom,hitting every nerve. &#34;Funny. People who are actually unwell always insist they&#39;re fine. Might be time to book yourself a session with a psychiatrist. And before I forget... cute necklace. But honestly? Junk stones aren&#39;t worth much these days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee&#39;s face turned ashen,her fury and humiliation overwhelming her. Without warning, she collapsed straight into Roger&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger carved hard lines into Roger&#39;s face as he pulled Marilee close, glaring at Alexia. &#34;I never realized you could be so cruel. Just because you wore my ring,you think you can say whatever you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Alexia could offer a comeback, a familiar voice cut through the tension, heavy with mockery. &#34;Really?That&#39;s your angle? Just because she wore your ring,you think you could speak to her like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A collective gasp swept through the crowd, all attention snapping to the doorway. There, tall and dangerously handsome,a man entered, charm radiating effortlessly with every step.</p>
