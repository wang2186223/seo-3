                <p>The moment the words left Waylons mouth, the space was filled with heavy tension</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every gaze snapped to Roger and Alexia, expectation simmering in the charged air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger blanched, his skin turning ashen, shoulders locking up as if the weight of the moment was turning him to stone, pride fracturing under the strain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Alexia; mixed feelings struck him-shock,disbelief,humiliation...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, Alexia&#39;s brows rose in genuine surprise, but her self-possession was back almost instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their standoff lasted only a moment before Roger dropped his eyes, shame washing over him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon didn&#39;t so much as blink, his voice cold and dismissive. &#34;If kneelingis too much for you, then disappear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s fists curled until his knuckles threatened to split, the sound stark in the charged quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at Waylon-the same figure who&#39;d always cast a shadow over every entitled heir in the city, a mountain none of them had ever managed to climb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, with years behind them. Roger found it impossible to meet Waylon&#39;s gaze without feeling that old sting of being lesser</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon had always wielded power like a scalpel-slicing egos, cutting pride, never breaking a sweat as he did it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roger, you have to help me,&#34; Brandon whimpered from where he lay sprawled, but Roger didn&#39;t move,his silence speaking volumes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing horrified him more than the thought of losing face in front of Alexia-groveling, admitting guilt,or falling to his knees was unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, he&#39;d done nothing to deserve this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon sent Simon a meaningful look, and Simon caught on instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, one of the men seized Brandon&#39;s injured hand, raised the blade, and cut off two fingers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sickening snap rang out, followed by a screamn so sharp and desperate it seemed to slice the air. Blood streamed from what was left of Brandon&#39;s hand as he writhed,his curses breaking into pitiful raqqed sobs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon watched the scene unfold, gaze steady From the way the hand hung limp it was clear Brandon would never use it again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon...&#34; Only then did Roger lurch forward desperately pressing on the wound, face drained of color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s eyes, red and brimming with pain, glared at his cousin. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you do anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to face him, Roger kept his head down, guilt eating at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low chuckle rumbled from Waylon&#39;s chest. He turned to Alexia and ran a hand lightly through her hair, as if nothing grim had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should go,&#34; he murmured, his voice soft, leaving everyone around them stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia stared at him, bewildered, but after a beat,she gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s eyes dipped to her shoes for a brief second.Before she could react, he leaned down and swept her into his arms with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise locked her in place, her mind whirling.Instinctively, her hands gripped his shirt, her heart lurching in het chest I&#39;m fine Just a few scrapes l can walk,&#34; she whispered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of warmth crept into Waylon&#39;s gaze as he offered a playful remark, saying. Oh, sure. Battling gangsters in heels and getting off with a few scrapes?That&#39;s something else. But I&#39;m carrying you anyway Indulge me,will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As usual, his logic left her with no comeback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s stride was unhurried, each step steady as he made his way to the sleek black sedan. Simon,always a step ahead, swung the door open before they reachedit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling into the back seat, Alexia paused, her voice low. &#34;What about the bodies in the factory?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow crossed Waylon&#39;s eyes. &#34;Don&#39;t concern yourself. I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met his look, her tone turning earnest. &#34;Thank you.Seems I&#39;m racking up favors | can&#39;t repay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet sigh escaped him. &#34;No debt this time. Let it go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for a medical kit resting on the seat, as if he&#39;d anticipated every need. Their driver, catching on,raised the partition, leaving them in a cocoon of silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia started to object. but Wayion&#39;s next command stopped her cold. &#34;Take off your shirt</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stiffened, caught off guard. Are you going to check my injuries? It&#39;s nothing serious, really!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon didn&#39;t look away, his eyes steady and unreadable. &#34;You can undress yourself, or I&#39;ll lend a hand.Your choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia shot upright. &#34;I&#39;ve got it! I&#39;ll do it myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her quick reply drew a faint, almost teasing smile from him,tinged with the faintest disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today she&#39;d thrown on a basic button-up. As her fingers stumbled over the top button, she felt lucky that she&#39;d worn a proper bra instead of her usual tape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she reached the last button, her hands had started to tremble, just enough to give her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the shirt falling open, pale skin and a patchwork of bruises and cuts came into view-a silent testament to the violence she&#39;d barely survived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s jaw tightened, his features darkening. Just seeing her injuries made his chest ache with a cold,silent rage. What those thugs suffered wasn&#39;t nearly enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it were up to him, Brandon would already be buried beside them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying nothing, he cracked open the medical kit,soaked a cotton pad in antiseptic, and began tending to her battered skin with deliberate care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the cool liquid met her wounds, Alexia flinched,letting out a sharp hiss. &#34;Ouch! That burns...&#34;</p>
