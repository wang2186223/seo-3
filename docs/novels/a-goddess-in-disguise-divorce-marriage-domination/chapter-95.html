                <p>\Waylon stood in the doorway, the crisp white shirt outlining the firm definition of his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth was set in a hard line, and his attention locked onto thne man beside Alexia with a fierce intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man stiffened under the pressure,clearly rattled.He took a nervous step back, trying to avoid Waylon&#39;s focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s eyes widened at the sight of him. &#34;Why are you here?&#34; she asked, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon gave a dry laugh. &#34;Why do you think?&#34; His eyes flicked over to Ada.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the tension fill the room, Ada immediately shrank behind Sylvia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia gave her a reassuring squeeze, doing her best to appear unfazed, though the tension in her posture betrayed her unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it became clear Alexia didn&#39;t grasp what was going on, Waylon&#39;s jaw tightened. He marched forward without pause, shoving the man away and pulling Alexia close without asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands came up to her face, giving ita brief shake as his voice dripped with contempt. &#34;Alexia, is this really your idea of fun? You&#39;ve got awful taste if this is what you&#39;re into.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insult landed like a punch. The men around them looked crushed, pride visibly dented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Sylvia flinched, stung by the implication. Taking a breath, she forced a smile through clenched teeth.&#34;These are the finest in the city. You can&#39;t even book them for less than a million per night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon tilted his head, a mocking smile playing on his lips. &#34;If that&#39;s your definition of premium, no wonder real quality&#39;s hard to find.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia&#39;s expression twitched in annoyance. Ada gently rubbed her back, whispering, &#34;Don&#39;t let him get to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon had always known how to hit a nerve. That much hadn&#39;t changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia pushed his hand away, baffled. &#34;Waylon, what are you doing right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a faint snort, the corner of his mouth lifting.&#34;What am I doing? Isn&#39;t it clear? My jealousy is practically gleaming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bluntness of his reply left her momentarily speechless. Her heart skipped, and a warm flush crept up her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was just a game,&#34; she mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon raised an eyebrow, his voice tinged with mockery. &#34;A kissing game? With strangers? That&#39;s your idea of fun?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassment flared in her chest, mingling with irritation. &#34;That&#39;s none of your business. Who do you think yyou are to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air shifted between them, the tension rising. Off to the side, Sylvia and Ada exchanged looks, silently enjoying the show as if watching a scene unfold in one of their favorite romance dramas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon didn&#39;t take offense. He studied her face carefully. &#34;That depends. Who do you want me to be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His forwardness caught her off guard. She quickly looked away, avoiding the question. Her tone turned brisk as she faced the others. &#34;Actually, I just remembered I&#39;ve got plans tonight. I&#39;m heading out,bye!&#34; She snatched her bag from the couch and walked off without giving them time to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia let out a long sigh, raising her hand in a half-hearted wave. &#34;Alright, bye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, Waylon sent a cold stare in Sylvia&#39;s direction. &#34;This shouldn&#39;t repeat itself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia huffed, smacking her thigh. &#34;What a drama queen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada nudged her and whispered, &#34;Can you not say that so loudly? He&#39;s still close by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, Waylon wasn&#39;t someone they wanted to cross.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Alexia stood in the elevator, her thoughts spinning out of control, thelingering alcohol only making everything worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t think straight, everything kept circling back to Waylon. The way he&#39;d looked at her, steady and sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt her heart race. Maybe she really was falling for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even admitting that to herself felt too risky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just gotten out of a terrible marriage. How could she be swayed again so soon? And by Waylon,of all people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, he was confident, good-looking, and seemed to have everything together, but was she truly that fragile? Did a single moment of affection fromn him really throw her off balance?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had spent most of their lives as rivals, not lovers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t afford to lose. Not now. Not ever,&#34; she muttered under her breath, as if the words could shield her. &#34;It&#39;s probably just hormones... or maybe the alcohol talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts ran so wild, she didn&#39;t see the person in front of her until it was too late. She walked straight into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching her forehead, she winced. &#34;Sorry, I wasn&#39;t paying attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man she bumped into, Tripp, looked surprised.But the moment he recognized her features, he seemed thrown off. &#34;It&#39;s alright,&#34; he replied, sounding flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia offered a faint, polite smile. Her head still felt light from the impact, and she reached for her phone, planning to book a ride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tripp hesitated, then took a breath and spoke up.&#34;Excuse me, could I get your contact number?&#34;</p>
