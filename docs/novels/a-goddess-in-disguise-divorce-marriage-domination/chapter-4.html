                <p>The call had barely ended when the soft click of the door caught Alexia&#39;s attention, her head snapping up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There in the doorway stood Waylon,his height casting a shadow,his expression giving nothing away as their eyes met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them had anticipated this kind of encounter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh from the shower,Alexia&#39;s hair clung damply to her cheeks, a robe slipping low on her shoulders,skin flushed and eyes still hazy with warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That oversized bathrobe, threatening to slip further,revealed soft lines of skin; the faint scent of shampoo lingered in the air, sweet and impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s gaze swept over her, lingering just long enough for her cheeks to flush, before he looked away calmly. &#34;Get ready. Breakfast is on the table.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later,Alexia emerged dressed,met by the aroma of a beautifully arranged breakfast. Hunger wvon out over pride; she took her seat without pretense,finishing most of the meal before pausing for breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little was said as Waylon let her eat in peace, only breaking the silence after she&#39;d nearly cleared her plate. &#34;You need a lawyer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set down her coffee cup. eyes meeting his squarely. &#34;So you&#39;ve heard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amusement tugged at his mouth, though his eyes stayed cold. &#34;Is there anyone left who doesn&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia tasted the bitterness of the coffee and grimaced for just a moment, though she quickly composed herself. &#34;I can deal with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the words left her mouth, she realized he might think she was too stubbom to admit she naadod holp.After all, in most people&#39;s eyes,womam baing dumped were pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you believe me when I say that?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk played on Waylon&#39;s face. eyes narrowing with a knowing glint. &#34;Why wouldn&#39;t l? Alexia, he&#39;s the one who should&#39;ve fallen apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That unwavering gaze held her still, though she managed a small, genuine smile in return. &#34;You&#39;ve always known how to make a good point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once breakfast was done, Alexia got ready to leave. Reaching the doorway, she stopped and glanced back.&#34;Thank you,&#34; she said quietly, her gratitude unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no chance she&#39;d forget his kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes had ticked past their appointment, and Roger&#39;s patience was quickly wearing thin as he and Marilee waited for Alexia in a private club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why isn&#39;t she here yetP ls tharefuking to divorce you?&#34;Marilee pressed hersolf clower to hum, wugar in hor tone as she poutod. &#34;You havan&#39;t forgottan our shopping plans, right? You promttnd yourd buy me a gown after this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger hummed in response The weokends banquet held by the Chamber of Commerce would be the perfect stage to introduce Manilee-the timing of her comeback couldn&#39;t have been more ideal. Every influential name in town would be present, all eyes fixed on Waylon&#39;s much-anticipated return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just thinking about Waylon sent a flicker of unease across Roger&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Chamber of Commerce&#39;s open support for Waylon right before the election of its new president wasn&#39;t exactly good news for the Gibson family. A sudden uproar near the doorway snapped Roger&#39;s focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head turned, and in that instant, itfelt as though the atmosphere in the room shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone&#39;s attention zeroed in on a single figure gliding inside with effortless grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia walked in, her crimson dress hugging every curve, heels whispering over the polished floor.Each stride radiated poise and quiet confidence. The scarlet hue, that unmistakable glow-sha looked like the sunrise brought to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each step Alexia took. Marilkm&#39;s smile grow tighter, until it disoppemrod mltogathor wthion Alexia claimed the seat across from them</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger couldn&#39;t hide his shock either, his eyes remained glued to Alexia&#39;s artfully made-up features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Words caught in his throat, visible in the small,nervous bob of his Adam&#39;s apple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody present could believe this woman was the same person from last night-the awkward glasses,the baggy checkered shirt, the sopping hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yesterday&#39;s pitiful girl had been replaced by someone utterly different, confident, unrecognizable. Nothing about their surprise caught Alexia off guard.Her beauty wasn&#39;t news to her; she&#39;d just chosen not to make a show of it. Childhood lessons had always emphasized modesty, staying out of the spotlight.never inviting too much notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marriage only tightened the leash. Years spent tending to Roger&#39;s grandmother and fielding disapproval from a mother-in-law who&#39;d been fed tales of her sO-called wild youth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even her hair or the color of her clothes escaped scrutiny. Every detail had been censored into drab submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vibrant dresses never made it to her closet-only baggy, forgettable options filled the shGlV04</p>
