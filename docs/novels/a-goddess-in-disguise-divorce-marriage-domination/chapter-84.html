                <p>In Korbin&#39;s eyes, nothing mattered more than protecting the family&#39;s honor and carrying on its legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was driven. He couldn&#39;t stand the idea of the Douglas family falling behind or staying idle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, holding power was like sailing through rough,unpredictable waters. If a family didn&#39;t have goals or direction, they could easily lose their way or even sink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After listening, Waylon rested his hands on his knee,fingers clasped. His posture alone showed he wasn&#39;t someone easily swayed. &#34;Alright then, what do you need from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;I&#39;ve been assigned to bring down the Styx Organization. You probably know their name-they&#39;ve been playing with biochemical weapons for years. But lately, they&#39;ve stepped it up-smuggling in illegal drugs and even kidnapping people for human experiments. It&#39;s becoming a major crisis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon frowned at the mention of that name. &#34;The Styx Organization has deep international roots. Their network is a mess of shady deals and violent attacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The government&#39;s been wanting to take them down for years, but wasn&#39;t that mission originally meant for Richard Hayes? Why are you the one handling it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a fair question. Korbin had made a name for himself in special forces, but given the Douglas family&#39;s influence, most assumed he had been placed in the military more for experience than actual danger</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People didn&#39;t expect someone from such a powerful family to be thrown into the worst missions</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Richard is getting old.&#34; Korbin gave a casual shrug &#34;The commander trusts me, and | acted fast-volunteered without telling my grandfather. So if anything happens to me out there, I&#39;m counting on you to look after my grandfather and Ada.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon looked at him with a deep gaze. &#34;You&#39;re betting everything on this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For noble families, protecting the bloodline was always a top priority. Most of the time,high-risk missions went to those with less to lose. People from powerful families usually took the safest, cleanest path to promotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin grinned.&#34;So what? I&#39;ve got what it takes to be a general. A man who&#39;s scared of taking risks doesn&#39;t belong in the army.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon stepped closer, placing a firm hand on Korbin&#39;s shoulder. His voice was steady. &#34;Then do one thing-come back alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Alexia didn&#39;t have to wait long. Soon,the housekeeper knocked on the door, herarms full of shopping bags. &#34;Miss Jenkins, the new clothes have arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia thanked her and brought the bags inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the bags and stared at the clothes for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was high-end, limited edition. Just the jacket alone was worth more than twNo hundred thousand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After slipping into one of the outfits, she went downstairs, only to realize Korbin was already gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Waylon and offered a polite goodbye.&#34;Thanks for your help. I&#39;ve got to get back to work.I&#39;ll transfer the money soon. And if you ever need something from me,just ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon arched a brow. &#34;Money? What money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gestured at the jacket. &#34;The clothes. That alone cost two hundred thousand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s expression stiffened and his tone turned flat.&#34;No need to act so formal with me. I don&#39;t like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia narrowed her gaze, folded her arms, and stepped closer. &#34;You don&#39;t want to be friends, and yet you won&#39;t accept payment either. Waylon, what exactly are youI playing at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t flinch, and took a step closer. &#34;Shouldn&#39;t l be asking you? You&#39;re smart. Haven&#39;t you figured it out yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his handsome face leaned in, Alexia&#39;s heart skipped a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet battle of wits began between them</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met his intense gaze and pretended to stay calm.&#34;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon gave a slow smile, his eyes locked on her like he could see right through her. It was getting harder for her to keep pretending. &#34;You know exactly what mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once,no one had known her better than him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia didn&#39;t push back. Her fingers curled into her palms-this felt too much like the mind games they used to play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only now, the game had changed. She felt clumsier and more unsure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Waylon, your vague talk is seriously irritating,&#34; she muttered after a long pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon chuckled. &#34;And you&#39;re cure when you say yes and mean no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered,Alexia turned away first, her cheeks warm.&#34;Fine, since you&#39;re feeling generous, I won&#39;t bother paying you back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she left in a hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she got into the car, she sat quietly for a bit,thinking. After a moment, she messaged Ada.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a feeling Waylon&#39;s planning something, and it has to do with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada replied right away, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia answered, &#34;I think he&#39;s trying to win my affection.&#34;</p>
