                <p>Spotting the silvery strands in Damon&#39;s hair, Alexia felt a swell of emotion that words couldn&#39;t touch. Her greeting came out earnest and quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile broke across Damon&#39;s face, his eyes gleaming as memories came rushing back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia had always stood out as his brightest student.Years ago,learning she&#39;d walked away from biology for marriage had left him simmering with disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Family mattered most to Alexia-sometimes to the point of obsession. That much, no one dared challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same devotion, however, left her wide open to disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a light squeeze to her shoulder, Damon gave her a welcoming pat. &#34;Glad to see you again. Let&#39;s eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d gone all out, ordering a spread of her favorites.Tasting the familiar díshes, Alexia felt a gentle warmth seep into her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not once had the Jenkins family shown this kind of care for her likes or dislikes. Funny-her old professor remembered better than any of them ever had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada and Nolan settled quietly into their seats. They concentrated on their food, wisely steering clear of the exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the comfortable silence, Damon leaned forward. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t believe the excitement in Afoross these days. Conferences, research breakthroughs, new contracts-our institute just landed a series of major projects. All of them trace back to that thesis you published back in the day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s fork paused midway, surprise freezing her hand. &#34;That&#39;s a big compliment. Sounds like a lot on your plate, though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp snort escaped Damon. &#34;Another reason I need you back in the lab. These aren&#39;t just any projects.What we&#39;re doing is about to shake up the whole field.It&#39;s a technologícal revolution, and you could be at the center of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet even his enthusiasm failed to move Alexia. She nibbled her food, unhurried. &#34;I&#39;ve been out of the biotech loop. At best,I could do a few guest lectures.That&#39;s all I&#39;m willing to promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finance had swallowed her life for two years now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saving the Jenkins family, salvaging their reputation -those had consumed every waking thought. Science belonged to another version of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dramatic sigh, Damon tossed up his hands.&#34;You&#39;re downplaying your talent again! If you hadn&#39;t married that useless man, you&#39;d be a leader in the field by now. Instead of wasting time in that joke of a marriage, you could have been making breakthroughs.You deserve better-good riddance to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada chimed in with a grin, &#34;That&#39;s right! With Roger out of the picture, maybe you&#39;ll finally spot a decent guy. Prof. Ellis, you must know some decent bachelors. Maybe set her up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon chuckled, eyes twinkling. &#34;Actually, I might.But only if she&#39;s willing to put herself back out there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia shook her head,putting an end to that line of talk. &#34;Not interested. I have other things on my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An eager gleam appeared in Damon&#39;s eyes. &#34;Does that mean you&#39;re ready to come back to work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught beneath the weight of their eager stares,Alexia let out a resigned breath. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll come to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delight danced in the professor&#39;s eyes as he snapped his fingers, barely able to contain his excitement.&#34;That&#39;s settled, then. By next month at the latest,I  want your paperwork done and your position official.Nolan, fetch the contract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Nolan reached over, unzipped his backpack, and produced a folder. He slid it and a pen smoothly across the table to Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those graceful, deliberate movements gave Alexia the unsettling sense that this had all been arranged well in advance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had she touched the pen than Damon leaned back with his coffee, his tone breezy. &#34;And if you ever find yourself wanting to date again, maybe give Waylon a try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grip faltered, pen nearly scrawling across the page.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s eyes glimmered with mischief. &#34;Come on,you know what I&#39;m talking about. I know you and Waylon have history. If he wasn&#39;t still holding out hope, would he have funneled all those prestigious research grants into our department? I&#39;ve heard the gossip. It&#39;s obvious who he&#39;s hoping to impress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock left Alexia frozen, a tangle of emotion knotting in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Waylon really been quietly involved in her life all this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disbelief flashed across Ada&#39;s face. &#34;You&#39;re kidding.That doesn&#39;t sound like him Waylon at all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an indifferent shrug, Damon brushed it off.&#34;That&#39;s for you to worry about. Either way, the deal with the government&#39;s already in ink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meal, Alexia and Ada made their way out together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon stretched out on the couch, tossing a look Nolan&#39;s way. &#34;So, what&#39;s it like meeting Alexia in person?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding the signed contract into his backpack, Nolan replied, &#34;She&#39;s even more striking in real life than in the pictures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh erupted from Damon. &#34;No surprise there.When she was still on campus, half the students were smitten. It&#39;s no wonder Waylon...&#34; He stopped himself,then spoke with extra weight. &#34;Things get messy at Afoross University. Keep an eye on her. Make sure nothing happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan tugged his cap further down, his bag slung over one shoulder. &#34;Relax. I won&#39;t let anyone mess with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada navigated the car through city traffic, taking Alexia home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they waited at a red light, Ada glanced over and caught Alexia typing rapidly on her phone. &#34;Who&#39;s got your attention?&#34;</p>
