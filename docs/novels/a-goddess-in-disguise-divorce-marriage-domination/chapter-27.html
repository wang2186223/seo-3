                <p>Was there any truth to what Pierson had said? Was there really some kind of history between Alexia and Waylon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question nagged at Marilee. Why would it be Alexia? What set her apart from everyone else?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how hard she had worked for her invitation, all her efforts suddenly seemed laughable compared to Alexia, who now drew everyone&#39;s admiration without even trying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pierson couldn&#39;t hide his awe. &#34;Waylon arrived with a companion tonight. Honestly, I can see why-she&#39;s stunning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence wrapped around Marilee as she digested his comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Pierson caught the strain in her expression. &#34;Marilee, is something wrong? Do you happen to know who she is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brittle smile broke through as Marilee replied,&#34;She&#39;s Alexia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That revelation seemed to catch Pierson off guard,but he let the matter rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the banquet hall, floral scents mingled with the rustle of silk gowns and the soft clinking of glassware.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrie Kennedy approached Zayne and raised her glass in greeting. &#34;Word is you pulled off a major deal overseas.Congratulations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He met her toast with a modest smile. &#34;That&#39;s flattering, but | wouldn&#39;t call it a major win. Let&#39;s just say I didn&#39;t return empty-handed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrie laughed softly. &#34;You always downplay your success. You&#39;re already quite accomplished. After all,no one can compare to Waylon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Waylon, Zayne&#39;s mood shifted, his expression turning thoughtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within their generation, Waylon had always stood apart, his name carrying a certain weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, they had gathered for one purpose-to welcome Waylon back from abroad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrie leaned in a bit closer. &#34;If I remember right,there&#39;s a bit of history between your family and Waylon, isn&#39;t there? That goes back years-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zayne cut her off quickly. &#34;That is ancient history.Truth be told, those days weren&#39;t exactly fond memories. Alexia always found a way to get under Waylon&#39;s skin, and he could barely tolerate her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrie raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised. &#34;Was Alexia really that fearless when she was little?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For as long as anyone could remember, Alexia had stayed out of the spotlight for many years, rarely making appearances at social gatherings. Had Marilee&#39;s dramatic return not made headlines, most people would have forgotten Alexia altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shrug was all Zayne offered. &#34;Boldness doesn&#39;t get you far if all it does is irritate people. Thankfully,she&#39;s not part of the Jenkins family anymore. If she were, I&#39;d be stuck handling the fallout.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a thoughtful swirl of her glass, Carrie kept pressing. &#34;Still, the Jenkins family took her in for over twenty years. Why do you dislike her so much?Because she stirred up trouble as a kid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zayne chose silence, refusing to revisit the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the atmosphere at the banquet shifted as a disturbance rippled through the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grand hall&#39;s chatter dropped off, all attention snapping to the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon strode into the hall, Alexia by his side, both of them commanding attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the pair together sent a ripple through the crowd. Eyes followed Alexia, filled with interest and speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soft whispers drifted across the room, quiet but no less intense than those outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does anyone know who Waylon&#39;s companion is?She&#39;s stunning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, is that Alexia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious? Alexia? Wasn&#39;t she once married to Roger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can anyone explain what&#39;s going on? How did Alexia end up on Waylon&#39;s arm? What&#39;s the story between those two?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrie shot a pointed look at Zayne, noticing the tension in his jaw. &#34;Are you absolutely certain that Waylon could barely tolerate her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had there truly been any animosity, Alexia would never have set foot inside, much less by Waylon&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On top of that, her divorce with Roger had been all over town. Who would risk inviting such controversy at an event like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room seemed to pause, caught off guard by her poise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, Bradly reached out his hand. &#34;The pleasure is ours, Ms. Jenkins. We&#39;re honored you could join us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s cool gaze swept the hall, and he spoke with a quiet authority. &#34;Alexia is here as my guest. I hope she has a wonderful evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single declaration sent ripples of shock across the room.</p>
