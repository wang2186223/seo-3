            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>After a moment of thought, Alexia snapped a quick photo of the corner of her divorce agreement and uploaded it to her feed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the caption, she simply typed, &#34;Free!&#34; and added a peace sign emoji.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as it went live, she chuckled at herself. The post felt a bit childish, but she didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, she just wanted to let the world know how she felt. Immature or not, it was her truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, a notification popped up. Curious,she tapped on it and saw that someone had already liked and commented on her post.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada had written, &#34;Congrats! We&#39;re going out tonight to celebrate-no excuses!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even through a screen, Ada&#39;s energy was infectious. Grinning, Alexia typed back a quick reply confirmning she&#39;d be there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a message came from Andre. &#34;Congrats! You&#39;re gonna find someone way better! Don&#39;t forget to keep me in mind-I&#39;m still single and ready anytime!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia exhaled a long sigh and replied, &#34;Thanks for the compliment, but seriously, why are you still like this? You know I&#39;m not into playboys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never taken Andre&#39;s pursuit seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Andre&#39;s grin faltered as he read her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, his usual charm couldn&#39;t cover the sting.His playful reputation had done him no favors, and now, he was realizing just how much it had cost him,especially with someone like Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret sowly settled in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Alexia was setting her phone down, it buzzed again, and this time with a call from her lawyer friend,Sylvia Courtenay. &#34;The private room&#39;s booked at the club tonight. Come have fun with Ada and me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia accepted without hesitation, asked for the address, and got ready to head out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Waylon sat quietly with his phone in hand. He stared at Alexia&#39;s post on his feed for a long time before finally tapping the like button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Star Club was one of the hottest venues in Afoross,known for its live band performances and the idol groups that often graced its stage. The place pulsed with energy every night, attracting the city&#39;s trendiest crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexia stepped through the entrance, she didn&#39;t even have to try to make an impression-heads turned naturally as she passed through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up on the second floor, leaning against the railing, a girl perked up the moment she spotted her. &#34;Tripp,hey! A stunning woman just walked in downstairs.I swear she looks exactly like your first love!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tripp Webster gave an eye-roll. &#34;Don&#39;t start, Zoe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shouldn&#39;t you be studying? What are you even doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe Webster retorted, &#34;What&#39;s wrong with taking a little break? Even students need fun. And this is your club, remember? You&#39;re the boss, not me. But seriously, go look for yourself. She looks just like that girl from the photo you used to hide back in high school!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tripp&#39;s cheeks colored slightly. &#34;Why are you still bringing that up? It was so long ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, curiosity tugged at him. He got up and joined her by the railing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There... by the entrance.&#34; Zoe pointed eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Down below, the club was alive. The music thumped,the crowd swayed, and the energy was electric. But Alexia stayed composed. She wasn&#39;t swayed by the noise or the chaos, nor did she seem irritated by any of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a delicate yet striking beauty-lively features paired with an unmistakable elegance. But it was the confidence in her eyes, bold and unshaken, that left a lasting impression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tripp blinked, momentarily stunned. The resemblance to his old crush was uncanny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexia finally reached the private room, Ada and Sylvia were already waiting inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What truly caught her off guard, though, were the two perfectly lined rows of strikingly handsome men,all decked out in sleek butler uniforms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada and Sylvia were clearly having the time of their lives, grinning ear to ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sylvia, one of Alexia and Ada&#39;s closest friends from their university days, had always been borilliant and fiercely loyal. Back in law school, she was not only top of the class but also the undeniable campus beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia!&#34; Sylvia beamed as she raised her glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re finally here! Tonight&#39;s all about you! Look at these handsome guys. Go ahead-take your pick and enio!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia blinked in surprise. &#34;Well, this is definitely not &#34;hatlexpected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her slight discomfort, one of the younger men came over with a kind smile. &#34;Come and sit with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was his boyish charm or the gentle coaxing tone, but Alexia found herself agreeing and sat down with him. As soon as she settled in, the young man popped open a chilled bottle of champagne and poured her a glass with smooth precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a small sip and glanced at his face-he was undeniably attractive, with bright eyes that made her feel a little unsettled. &#34;How old are you, exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled, a bit shyly. &#34;Just turned eighteen last month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That nearly made Alexia choke on her drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alarmed, he leaned forward and gently patted her back as she coughed. &#34;Hey, are you alright?&#34;</p>
