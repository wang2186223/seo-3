                <p>Alexia brushed off a sudden sense of discomfort,steadying herself with composure. &#34;Andre and I are just friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Andre leaned in and added, &#34;Friends for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smirk, Elton gave Andre a look up and down,clearly not convinced, and teased, &#34;So you&#39;re pursuing her,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre scowled at the remark. &#34;Why do you care so much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a false air of seriousness, Elton shrugged.&#34;Doesn&#39;t bother me at all. I just wonder what Waylon would say if he caught wind of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flickered across Alexia&#39;s features. &#34;He wouldn&#39;t bother with something like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Elton could continue,the manager appeared,his shirt damp from sweat and a nervous smile plastered on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pardon me for stepping in, everyone. What happened today was never our intention. We&#39;ll handle the disruptive woman and make things right with Mr. Ortiz.Elite Bar will pay for all medical expenses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of Healy Ortiz&#39;s crew, still angry, spoke up.&#34;Your money means nothing to us. She went after our boss. If we let her off easy, how can he walk into a room with his head held high? Stop wasting time and hand her over!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught between a rock and a hard place, the manager hesitated.WVhile Healy had a bit of money, the girls trained by Elite Bar brought in far greater profits. And the said girl had a future worth protecting. Letting them have her would ruin all of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s there to think about? You&#39;re holding on to her like she&#39;s worth more than our boss!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s gaze drifted toward the woman, head bowed and features hidden, saying nothing. Right as she opened her mouth, Elton cut in, &#34;You think your boss,looking the way he does, could measure up to someone like her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That comment set off laughter all around. Just as the group was about to respond, the manager bent at the waist before Elton.r. Clark, please don&#39;t take offense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment that name left his lips, Healy&#39;s men grew uneasy. It was clear now that Elton wasn&#39;t a man they wanted to cross.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the hall now silent, Elton offered a cold,dismissive laugh, then turned to the woman. &#34;Look up.Let me see your face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice left no room for questions, sending a chill through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertainty flickered across the woman&#39;s face as she slowly raised her chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant Alexia caught sight of those jewel-bright green eyes, a jolt of shock ran through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no mistaking the resemblance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s breathtaking!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never seen anyone so beautiful. Now l understand why she saved her entrance for last-she outshines them all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre, caught off guard, found himself impressed.Still, unease crept in the longer he studied her.Leaning closer to Alexia, he whispered, &#34;How could someone like the chief engineer at Dracfield Military Tech end up in a place like this? Even if she&#39;s undercover,putting someone that gifted at risk makes no sense. If anything happens to her, what&#39;ll become of their entire team?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia could only look at him, at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While whispers passed among the crowd, Elton knelt down,eyes fixed on the woman before letting a sly grin spread across his lips. &#34;I want this woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement stirred beneath the manager&#39;s anxious exterior, barely hidden by his mask of professionalism.&#34;To catch your eye is a blessing for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elton brushed off the compliment. &#34;And let me make this clear. I have no patience for people drooling over what&#39;s mine. Break their legs and toss them out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his words landed,fear swept through the group. &#34;Mr. Clark! We&#39;d never cross you, please believe us!&#34; But the manager, following orders,summoned the guards and had them dragged away without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pained yells soon echoed from the entrance, chilling everyone left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the ordeal done, Elton was ready to lead the woman away when Alexia suddenly called out, &#34;Kyra Francis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name made Elton stop in his tracks, and the woman&#39;s steps faltered beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned back and asked, &#34;Who did you just call?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Searching the woman&#39;s face, Alexia spotted uncertainty and offered a small smile. &#34;I&#39;m sorry; l thought you were someone else. May I know your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bella Coleman,&#34; the woman replied. Her reply was gentle, her tone softer than anyone expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please forgive me,&#34; said Alexia, retrieving a business card from her bag and offering it. &#34;If you ever need help,call me. I&#39;ll have your back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elton&#39;s jaw clenched as he struggled to maintain his polished smile. &#34;Alexia, what are you trying to imply?&#34;</p>
