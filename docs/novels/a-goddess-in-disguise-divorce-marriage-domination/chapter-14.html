                <p>Brandon was hunched over, holding his lower half like his life depended on it. His face twisted in pain as he let out a loud cry, like his soul had just been ripped from his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scene was so shocking that even the club&#39;s security guards froze in place. His blond friend ran over in a panic, glancing nervously toward Brandon&#39;s lower half. &#34;Bro, are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s face twisted with fury, and his voice broke as he yelled, &#34;Do I look okay to you? That crazy woman just kicked me. What are you all waiting for?Go grab her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to his shock, not a single guard moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, they looked past him, their faces turning serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noisy crowd fell silent in an instant, like someone had flipped a switch. Conversations died mid-sentence. People began stepping aside without thinking, clearing a path straight through the middle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, cutting voice broke the silence. &#34;Brandon,who do you think you&#39;re messing with? And where&#39;d you get the nerve?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads turned as Ada appeared, arm-in-arm with her older brother, Korbin Douglas. Behind them, a squad of bodyguards in black followed closely. Their entrance didn&#39;t just command attention-it consumed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew the Douglas siblings were close, but it was uncommon to see them in public together. Still,those who paid close attention noticed something else-both siblings walked to the left, while Elton Clark, the second son of the powerful Clark family,walked to the right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the one walking dead center was the man everyone instinctively focused on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tall,sharp-featured,and exuding a cold,commanding presence-Waylon. His aura was so strong, it felt like no one could touch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God, it&#39;s him! It&#39;s really Waylon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa, no way-that&#39;s actually Waylon? How can someone look that insanely good? There&#39;s gotta be a law against it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh! Keep your voice down unless you want security throwing you out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The energy in the crowd crackled, even as people tried to stay composed. All eyes followed Waylon like he was royalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon had been a legend since his school days. Even after being gone from Afoross for seven years,his name never faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While industries collapsed and markets struggled during economic downturns, he managed to breathe life back into Afoross&#39;s industries all by himself. Now,his name was known around the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the business world, Waylon wasn&#39;t just influential -he was the kind of figure people looked to when everything else was falling apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each of his steps echoed in that club like a slow-moving thunderclap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he passed, his eyes barely glanced at Brandon-cold and uninterested. But even that was enough. The guards immediately stepped in, dragging Brandon away like garbage blocking the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s pride took a hit, hisdignity crumbling right there, but he didn&#39;t dare say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew better than to challenge someone like Waylon-the man at the center of the most powerful circle of heirs. Picking a fight with him wasn&#39;t just foolish, it was suicide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elton smirked as Brandon was dragged away like a kicked dog. &#34;Bet Alexia&#39;s cringing watching this. Back in the day, she used to rush into casinos to defend that idiot. Got up in my face more than once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada gave a half-laugh, sounding a little embarrassed &#34;Come on, we&#39;ve all made dumb choices when we were younger. Alexia&#39;s sober now. Why else do you think she completely humiliated Brandon today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin raised an eyebrow. &#34;So she&#39;s finally woken up and come to her senses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes slid over to Alexia, still standing alone near the stairs. &#34;Doesn&#39;t really seem like that to me. And she has Andre backing her up, doesn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t even finished talking before Ada sharply pinched him under his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin winced, plastering on an awkward smile as he turned to Waylon. &#34;Maybe she actually does regret it.Who knows?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon stayed silent, but his eyes found Alexia&#39;s. In that split second, she saw it-just beneath his calm,polished surface was an unmistakable flash of annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They brushed past each other, barely inches apart,when Alexia suddenly reached out and grabbed his  wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon stopped. And with him, the entire area seemed to freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice came out low, steady, and cold. &#34;Let go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere tightened in an instant-no one moved, no one breathed. But Alexia didn&#39;t blink. She Looked up at him, all composed, and said with a light smile, &#34;Can we talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s eyes narrowed. A slow, unreadable smile tugged at his lips. &#34;Talk about what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension was thick enough to choke on. Even Ada Looked like she was about to say something,but Korbin quietly held her back with a hand on her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia stayed calm, letting the silence stretch for another moment. Then, with a gentletilt of her chin,she said, &#34;Let&#39;s talk inside. It&#39;s freezing out here, don&#39;t you think,Wally?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reaction was immediate, like tossing a spark into a pool of gasoline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps erupted through the crowd, disbelief spreading like ripples on water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,did she just call him Wally?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is she? And how does she have the guts to call him that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She said it like it was normal. And look at him-he&#39;s not even mad. What even is their relationship?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Elton and Korbin exchanged looks, both taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn! Alexia still knew exactly how to manipulate Waylon.</p>
