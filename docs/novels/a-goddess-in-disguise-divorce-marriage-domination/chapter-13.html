                <p>Chapter. People are still building off your research, you know. Those papers?Major impact. Professor Damon Ellis hasn&#39;t stopped bragging about you, his star student. He keeps pestering the department, telling everyone you&#39;re the best mind to come through in decades. He&#39;s ready to roll out the red carpet if you say yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mixed feelings knotted inside Alexia. She had abandoned her ambitions and the scientific world she loved, all to play the flawless wife and keep the Jenkins and Gibson families afloat. Her old life had slipped through her fingers, sacrificed for a future that now felt painfully empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For ages, Ada had tried to coax her out of hiding, but every attempt met a wall-Alexia simply had nothing left to give.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking back now, regret gnawed at her. She had thrown away years for people who barely remembered to say thank you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolve hardened inside her, tugging her lips into a confident smile. &#34;Make it happen. Let&#39;s have that conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement bubbled over in Ada&#39;s reply. &#34;Finally! You have no idea-things in the bio department are wild right now. They&#39;re signing government deals, cash is pouring in, but honestly, they&#39;re desperate for real talent. Even the Chamber of Commerce is sniffing around.My brother&#39;s been prying for details nonstop,but I&#39;m just the admin. All those power plays are way above my pay grade.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she heard the Chamber of Commerce,Alexia couldn&#39;t help picturing Waylon. &#34;Is your family caught up in the shake-up over there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A light laugh floated through the line. &#34;Trust me,Douglas blood runs too thick for politics to scare us off. And with Mason stepping up? My brother&#39;s over the moon. He&#39;s already set on meeting him at the Equestrian and Shooting Tournament this weekend.Guess what? I&#39;m a VIP at the club running the event.You should tag along-it&#39;ll be the perfect way to talk job details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The timing felt almost cinematic. Amusement danced in Alexia&#39;s eyes, and her grin grew sharper. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t miss it for anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fast forward to the next day, and the Apex MAarksman Club buzzed with activity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia hadn&#39;t even gotten past the doors when trouble decided to greet her head-on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, blocking the entrance, stood Brandon,dressed like he&#39;d rolled straight out of a motorcycle magazine,hair a blinding shade of cherry red, the poster child for privileged trouble. The glare he gave her could have cut glass.Clearly, seeing her again was the last thing he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their last meeting had left his pride in shambles. This club was meant to be his escape, but fate seemed set on throwing Alexia right back in his path</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could his luck get any worse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His blond friend stood next to him, grinning widely,totally unaware of the tension in the air. &#34;&#39;Hold up-isn&#39;t that your cousin&#39;s ex? The one who got tossed out? Didn&#39;t think she&#39;d show her face here. Bet she&#39;s busy scrounging for spare change these days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his friend nearby, Brandon straightened his shoulders and let out a sneer. &#34;Honestly, what else do you expect from a woman like her? She&#39;s here to find herself a new man. I bet she thinks none of us decent guys can tell she&#39;s nothing but trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words echoed a little louder than necessary.baiting the curiosity of every bystander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did something just happen? Who&#39;s he calling out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, is it her? What did she do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s smile chilled the air, dripping with disdain as she fixed her gaze on him. &#34;So all that barking was yours, Brandon? So, did you manage to pass your make-up tests this time? Or are you still drowning in gambling debts? Honestly, with all the times you&#39;ve been fooled, I&#39;m amazed there&#39;s anything left up there -if you can call it a brain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush crept up Brandon&#39;s neck, his temper boiling over. &#34;Tell me what part of what I said is wrong. This is a private club, not for a whore-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could even finish, Alexia sent him flying with a single, well-aimed kick, sending him sprawling down the marble steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of shock rippled through the crowd as Brandon crashed and rolled, groaning, his pride shattered along with his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stillness settled for a split second. Then the whole place erupted All eyes locked on Alexia&#39;s blood-red heels, the kind that meant business. One kick from those and the damage was unforgettable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around, men instinctively drew their knees together, wincing in collective sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was enough to wipe out an entire family tree.</p>
