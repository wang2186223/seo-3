                <p>Relief flickered across Alexia s face as soon as Waylon appeared, her eyes lighting up while the tension in her shoulders melted away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though part of her had guessed that Waylon might trace trouble after their sudden phone disconnect, she had tried not to let herself hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Depending on anyone else had always felt riskier than counting on herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Alexia could come up with a story to explain the dead bodies of the thugs, Waylon was already there, wrapping her tightly in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hold was fierce-unyielding, as if he could somehow protect her by keeping her close enough to become a part of him. He tucked his chin against her hair, breathing in the subtle scent, and with that, the storm inside him finally settled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pinned to his chest, Alexia could make out the wild,uneven thumping of his heart. The heavy beat vibrated through her own ribs, and before she could stop it, her pulse started racing in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief shock ran through her. She realized it was Waylon&#39;s embrace that had set her heart pounding so fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around them, people took in the scene-some whispered behind cupped hands, a few stared, and others quickly looked away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Waylon released her, his arms dropping back to his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick scan took in every detail-dust on her cheeks,smudges on her clothes-but her eyes still shone bright and impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze turned stormy when he noticed the streak of blood on her arm. Picking up on his mood,Alexia shrugged, voice light. &#34;Just a scratch from the bulet.Nothing serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated only a moment, then offered a faint careful smile-completely sidestepping the fact that he&#39;d just held her as if he&#39;d never let go. As though nothing had passed between themat all. Instead,she asked, &#34;So what brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;You were in trouble. How could I not come? I&#39;m just glad I made it in time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flickered in Alexia&#39;s gaze, her eyes going round as Waylon&#39;s words sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle wind stirred, teasing the loose strands of hair on her forehead. Fot a fleeting second she wondered if spring was finally softening the citys edges. the breeze brushing her skin like a memory</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment passed. Waylon s focus cut to Brandon.sprawled on the ground, twisted with pain and barely able to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face hardened to stone. Without so much as a backward glance, he gave his order, voice cold enough to freeze. &#34;Break his hands and legs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On it,&#34; came Simon&#39;s immediate reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s entire body went rigid. Dropping to his knees, he crawled desperately, voice shaking as he pleaded, &#34;Mr. Mason, please! I&#39;m begging you-don&#39;t!I didn&#39;t want any of this, I swear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sneer played on Waylon&#39;s lips. &#34;Who do you think you&#39;re begging for help? If you want forgiveness, turn around and ask her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Brandon seemed paralyzed. Then he turned, only to find Alexia looking back at him with a cold, unblinking stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down his cheeks as he dragged himself to her, sobbing. &#34;Alexia, please, I&#39;m sorry.I mean it! We&#39;re family. Think of my grandmother. Let me off, just this once! I&#39;ll never do anything like this again,I promise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s eves only grew colder her brows drawn tight &#34;You&#39;re no family of mine Dont reach for something that isn&#39;t there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her world, loyalty was everything. Betrayal left no room for forgiveness</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon moved without delay, giving a silent signal. His team grabbed Brandon and hauled him up, offering no compassion at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A baton tipped with jagged steel came down,smashing into the back of Brandon&#39;s knees with brutal force. The sickening crunch of bones snapping shattered the stillness of the factory, echoing like a gunshot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, no sound escaped Brandon&#39;s lips-his mouth stretched wide in a silent scream before pure agony ripped the noise from his throat. The resulting howl was enough to chill the blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brandon!&#34; Roger, who had just arrived with his crew,caught the tortured scream the instant he climbed out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sprinted toward the sound, only to find Brandon lying on the ground, covered in blood, his legs broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Teeth gritted, Roger shot Waylon a look of dark fury.&#34;What the hell have you done to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be asking what hes done. Waylon&#39;s voice came back lee cold, a rare flash of anger sparking beneath thte words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The temperature in the area dropped with Waylon&#39;s outburst, a suffocating chill sweeping through the space. No one else dared to move or even meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s chest tightened, dread settling deep in his gut Facing Waylon&#39;s wrath was never easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the ground,Brandon reached out, face twisted in agony. &#34;Roger, help me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With fists clenched at his sides, Roger hesitated, then forced himself to bow his head before Waylon,humility creeping into his tone. &#34;Whatever my cousin&#39;s done,the Gibson family will make amends.Please,let us set things right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, dangerous smile crept onto Waylon&#39;s lips,equal parts refined and menacing. &#34;If you&#39;re serious about that, you can start by dropping to your knees and begging Alexia for forgiveness.&#34;</p>
