                <p>With the auction drawving to a close, Waylon found himself caught up in polite conversation with several distinguished gentlemen, while Alexia, guided by her assistant, made her way out to the entrance to wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lingered alone by the fountain, the night air nipping at her skin. Marilee, spotting her, couldn&#39;t resist a jab. &#34;So, the woman everyone stared at tonight ends up left out in the cold. Roger, why don&#39;t you offer her a ride?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold look passed over Roger&#39;s face as he shot Alexia a glare. &#34;Does she even need help from us?Alexia, you&#39;ve really mastered social climbing. We just mentioned divorce, and you latched right onto Waylon. Now you&#39;ve got Andre in tow too. Bet you&#39;re feeling proud of yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words dripped with contempt, meant to wound,yet Alexia only blinked, her tone calm and undisturbed. &#34;That&#39;s right. So what are you going to do about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answer caught Roger off guard, his mouth momentarily hanging open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Marilee was taken aback by her audacity, not expecting her to disregard her own reputation so completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a nonchalant flick of her hair, Alexia continued,&#34;Whether it&#39;s Andre or Waylon, either is an upgrade over someone like you. Everyone wants something better, don&#39;t they? Why shouldn&#39;tl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A man like me? Even at my worst, I&#39;m still above a woman who would sell herself for a leg up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scornful laugh escaped Alexia. &#34;You&#39;re in no place to lecture me. Tell me, where was your so-called morality when you and Marilee sneaked around behind my back? At least I&#39;m open about being with attractive, wealthy men-and frankly, I&#39;m enjoying myself. Is that what bothers you, Roger? That they outshine you in every way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Marilee found herself at a loss,recognizing that after divorce, Alexia had become someone bolder and far more incisive than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury clouded Roger&#39;s thoughts after her biting words. &#34;You&#39;re just leaning on other people! None of your success is truly your own!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s nonsense. If I end up with what I want, that&#39;s ability in my book.&#34; Alexia leaned in, voice playful.&#34;And if we&#39;re splitting hairs, Roger, everything you call your own comes courtesy of the Gibson family.Connections, money, influence-tell me, what have you ever built yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bristled, retorting, &#34;I was born with those things!That&#39;s different!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze turned cold. &#34;Does that make you some kind of noble? You inherit everything, never feel a hint of embarrassment, and still judge me for taking advantage of what I have. Don&#39;t kid yourself-there are plenty of people out there with more brains and drive than you. Strip away your family&#39;s legacy and ask yourself what&#39;s left before you point fingers at me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flared in Roger&#39;s eyes-her last words had struck exactly where he was most vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Marilee, who usually kept quiet in such spats,couldn&#39;t help lashing out. &#34;You&#39;re banking on youth and a pretty face, Alexia! Let&#39;s see how long that gets you. One day, you&#39;ll be tossed aside just like anyone else!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of mischief lit Alexia&#39;s face as she arched a brow. &#34;So you do see the value in beauty, after all?Good to know you&#39;re not completely blind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee&#39;s expression faltered, momentarily thrown off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation simmered beneath her calm, and for the first time, she could truly understand Roger&#39;s anger-her own thoughts scattered with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s got everyone so animated over here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s approach drew Alexia&#39;s attention, and she turned to find his keen eyes fixed on the group,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>searching for answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied with a smile, &#34;Nothing major. Just a bit of conversation, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s gaze swept over Roger and Marilee, then landed back on Alexia. &#34;People like that will only drag you down. Best not to keep their company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A visible tremor ran through Roger as those words landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an easy movement, Alexia slipped her hand into the crook of Waylon&#39;s arm, nodding inagreement.&#34;Believe me, I&#39;d rather not, but I still have to wrap up this divorce.&#34; Her attention shifted back to Roger,and her eyes turned frosty. &#34;Be at the courthouse at nine tomorrow morning. Don&#39;t make me send someone to fetch you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger struggled to hide the flood of emotion that washed over him-shock, humiliation, and even fear flickering in his eyes. Alexia caught every nuance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Detecting the cloud over her mood, Waylon gently took her hand. &#34;Let&#39;s get out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Side by side, Alexia and Waylon strolled off, while Roger and Marilee were left behind, shivering beneath the chilly night air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, the car carried Alexia back to her hotel.As the vehicle rolled to a stop, a thought surfaced.She reached for the necklace and addressed the man beside her. &#34;I should give this necklace back to you now.&#34;</p>
