                <p>Alexia&#39;s smile faltered into something tight and forced,then she clenched her jaw. &#34;Forget everything I just said. I take it all back.Waylon,you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;Ll win the Adam&#39;s Heart for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words froze mid-air, and her eyes narrowed in suspicion.&#34;That&#39;s a sudden change of heart, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon gave a calm nod, as unbothered as ever. &#34;But it comes with a condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia stiffened slightly. &#34;Say it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause. Then, Waylon said casually, &#34;That night, you&#39;ll be mnine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Waylon asked you to be his date?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second Alexia stepped outside the club, Ada was already there waiting, and the moment she heard what happened inside, she practically leapt out of her heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia remained cool. &#34;That was all his call. He said I&#39;d be staying beside him during the charity gala as his date. I warned him my reputation&#39;s in ruins, but he didn&#39;t seem to mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada quickly yanked her into a corner and whispered urgently, &#34;Alexia, listen-Waylon has never brought a woman to an event like this. Not once. And this gala?It&#39;s not just another high-society cocktail party. It&#39;s a big deal. I&#39;m seriously worried he&#39;s setting you up for something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia lifted an eyebrow. &#34;Setting me up? Wow. You make it sound like you&#39;re scared of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon had always been distant, frosty even-a total iceberg since they were kids. But Alexia had never seen Ada this shaken before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada hesitated, wrestling with her thoughts, before sighing like she&#39;d finally given in.&#34;Don&#39;t you think he&#39;s different now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Taller. More attractive. Definitely aged like fine wine.&#34; Alexia nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada rolled her eyes hard. &#34;You&#39;re hopeless. Seriously.You&#39;d follow a handsome guy off a cliff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia simply gave a casual shrug. &#34;Handsome guys exist so we can enjoy the view, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada let out a deep sigh. &#34;All jokes aside, you need to hear this. It&#39;s official--Waylon&#39;s being positioned as the next president of the Chamber of Commerce. And trust me, the timing isn&#39;t random. Dane Warren was supposed to serve at least two terms. He had everything-experience, support, influence, but he was pushed out almost overnight. You really think he gave that up willingly? No chance. One by one,everyone connected to his camp has been quietly wiped out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada shivered, goose bumps creeping up her arms.&#34;Anyone who picked the wrong side ended up in a terrible situation-some say even worse than dying.Even those who were once friendly with the Mason family weren&#39;t spared. It didn&#39;t matter how close you were or how much you pleaded. Waylon is ruthless.Sure, we come from powerful families, but that doesn&#39;t give us immunity. He&#39;s not someone to provoke, Alexia. Just promise me you&#39;ll be careful.Keep your distance, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia stared at Ada&#39;s pale face, something unfamiliar twisting in her gut-an edge of worry she couldn&#39;t ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada had always been fiery and untouchable growing up-spoiled rotten, guarded by her powerful family and that hawk of a brother, Korbin. Nobody had ever dared mess with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet now, she was intimidated by Waylon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia replied calmly, &#34;If he&#39;s really as unstoppable as you say, staying out of his way might not change anything. Some things find you anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing how worried Ada looked, Alexia softened her tone. &#34;Relax. Honestly, I&#39;m not a big deal right now.The Jenkins and Gibson families don&#39;t hold much value for someone like him. And if this is a setup,let him try. He&#39;s not the only one who knows how to play the game. Just because he starts it doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll lose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada looked at her with visible worry. &#34;God, I really hope I&#39;m just being paranoid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, they drove to Afoross University.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the bright sky, the air cut sharp and bitter-it was January at its harshest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada parked close to the entrance, and the two walked the remaining stretch toward the university gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Near the gates, Alexia noticed a tall guy leaning against a wall, hands tucked in his hoodie pocket,headphones resting over his ears. His head was tilted back slightly, like he was half-asleep or maybe just soaking in the weak winter sunlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada waved as they approached. &#34;Nolan! Over here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened at her voice and strolled over with casual ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada jumped in with introductions. &#34;Alexia, meet Nolan Hayes. He&#39;s in your department. One of those early-admission prodigies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia glanced him over. Lean frame, sharp features,fresh-faced with just enough cocky energy to give away his age. His student ID hung around his neck like a blinking neon sign. She raised a brow. &#34;What are you,sixteen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada almost burst out laughing but quickly held it in,while Nolan stayed perfectly calm and replied in the driest tone imaginable, &#34;I&#39;m eighteen. Senior year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right.&#34; Alexia&#39;s lips twitched, mildly amused at herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan continued, &#34;Professor Ellis said you&#39;d be here today.Asked me to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia gave a small nod, a smirk tugging at her lips.&#34;Alright, lead the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked across campus to a quiet little restaurant tucked just off the main quad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Damon Ellis was already waiting, seated in a private booth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was dressed down in simple athletic wear, holding a mug like a man deep in his weekend routine. But the second Alexia stepped in, the energy shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set the mug aside and stood up, his demeanor sharpening as his gaze locked on her.</p>
