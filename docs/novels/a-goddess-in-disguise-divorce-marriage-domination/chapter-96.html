                <p>Alexia did not even bother to lift her eyes. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tripp stood there, feeling awkward and let down as he stared at her. &#34;Do you have a boyfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she had a chance to answer, Waylon caught up and grabbed her hand. He ignored Tripp completely. &#34;Alexia, I never knew you could be so shy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color rushed into Alexia&#39;s cheeks. She jerked her hand back and covered her ears, darting ahead.&#34;Who&#39;s shy? That&#39;s not me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon let out a quiet laugh, trailing behind her with slow steps. His eyes softened with a look she could not quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tripp watched their exchange until they disappeared through the doorway. He pulled out a cigarette, lit it,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and took a few slow puffs before the urge faded awav.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she already had a boyfriend. Disappointment settled over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Alexia could not flag down a taxi and ended up getting swept into Waylon&#39;s car instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around them, the city sparkled under the night lights, cars rushing by in every direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia sat in the passenger seat, her head clouded from drinking, and found herself sneaking glances at Waylon,studying his features quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes drifted to his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered hearing once that men with lips like his were considered the most alluring, the kind that drew women in without effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether or not that was true, Alexia could not deny that Waylon had an undeniable charm. If he had ever wanted to, the rumors about his love life could have filled a book by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the truth was-if it had not been for her, his reputation would have stayed spotless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man like that made it hard for her not to fall for him,but she could not help worrying that it might all end in heartbreak once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must have let her eyes linger too long, because when the car stopped at a red light, Waylon glanced over with a curious look. &#34;What were you staring at just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia hesitated for a moment, then pointed out the window and said simply, &#34;It just looks beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon followed her finger and saw a huge flower bed woven with bright neon lights. Nearby, a fountain sparkled in the glow, reminding him of stars scattered across the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took in the scene for a moment. &#34;You&#39;re right, it really is beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia grinned. &#34;That&#39;s because I&#39;ve got an eye for spotting beauty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could say anything more, she heard Waylon&#39;s quiet laugh close to her ear. &#34;Alexia, I was talking about you. You look amazing with the lights on your face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His comment sent her heart skipping. She glanced up at his warm smile, keeping her guard up around this dangerously charming man. &#34;You keep flattering me while I&#39;m tipsy. Are you hoping I&#39;ll come home with you tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon arched his eyebrow, a flash of surprise showing before his usual calm returned. &#34;Then... are you coming home with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s cheeks turned pink. &#34;No way! I&#39;mn going to my own place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just grinned and played along. &#34;Whatever you say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their playful banter, Alexia felt a wave of drowsiness wash over her. Before long, she drifted off, her head resting against the seat, lips parted as she slipped into gentle, even breaths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon let out a silent sigh. He noticed how she kept her guard up, yet somehow, she was not all that distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they finally pulled up to Alexia&#39;s place, Waylon reached over and gently nudged her awake. &#34;Come on, we&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still lost in a sleepy haze, Alexia turned away and complained quietly about feeling dizzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon asked, &#34;Do you want me to carry you inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, Alexia stretched out her arms. &#34;Yes, please. I really don&#39;t want to walk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she wanted to be carried, then he was happy to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon leaned down and scooped her up, holding her securely in his arms. Alexia tucked herself against him, shifting now and then as she searched for a more comfortable spot to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept fidgeting, and it made the walk up to her apartment a bit of a challenge for Waylon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they reached her door, he prompted her to open it. Thankfully, her place was equipped with a fingerprint lock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After setting her down on the living room couch,he carefully smoothed out her tangled hair. She remained sound asleep, eyes closed and breathing softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon glanced at Alexia, still tipsy and peaceful,then headed for the kitchen to check the fridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He decided he would cook some soup before heading out.</p>
