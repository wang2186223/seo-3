                <p>Chapter in her life much faster than she ever expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon studied her for a long second, tilting his head. &#34;Do you always disarm people like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia blinked in confusion. &#34;I&#39;m just being honest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon let out a low chuckle and leaned in slightly.&#34;Well, it&#39;s the first time a woman&#39;s ever given me flowers, so I wouldn&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia froze for a moment, unsuire how to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Alexia, if anyone deserves thanks, it&#39;s you. You should be thanking yourself. For some people, your presence is the best gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Alexia quickly looked away, trying not to get lost in his magnetic gaze. She cleared her throat and shifted the topic. &#34;Anyway, I also wanted to say sorry about last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon, now absently adjusting the bouquet in his hands, gave her a side glance. &#34;A casual apology like that? No way. That&#39;s something we&#39;ll need to talk about properly. And do you really want to air our private business in front of everyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia turned her head and realized a sizable crowd had formed, eyes wide with curiosity, whispers swirling around them like a breeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking twice, she grabbed Waylon&#39;s arm and dragged him away. &#34;Let&#39;s jst go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon didn&#39;t resist, letting her pull him along. A faint smile tugged at his lips. &#34;By the way, I prefer irises over roses. Just keep that in mind next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia shot him a look, her voice dry. &#34;Then buy them yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, a group of employees exchanged stunned glances, struggling to believe what they had just seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexia and Waylon walked off together under the curious gaze of everyone around, it didn&#39;t take long for whispers to explode into full-blown gossip, filling the air with wild speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see that? Mr. Mason actually accepted those flowers!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable. I wonder if I start showing up with flowers every day, will I stand a chance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You? With your face? Simon wouldn&#39;t even let you past security!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s be real, guys. It&#39;s not about flowers or tricks.It&#39;s about being the right person. If you&#39;re the one,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>even a piece of string looks like a diamond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you! Alexia&#39;s on another level. That girl&#39;s playing in the big leagues!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Simon cut through the crowd, clearly annoyed by the gossip. He shot them a sharp look.&#34;Who gave you permission to call her by her first name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group looked at each other, confused. &#34;Uh, then what are we supposed to call her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon gave a quiet sigh. &#34;You might have to call her Mrs.Mason someday.&#34;</p>
