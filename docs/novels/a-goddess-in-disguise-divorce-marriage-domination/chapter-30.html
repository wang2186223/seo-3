                <p>&#34;Countless stars have companions, but this one drifts through the vast darkness alone. Some might call it lonely, yet the designer sees something different. In his mind, the star never pities itself.True wisdom, he believes, belongs to those unafraid of solitude, those who light their own way, untouched by the darkness around them. The largest sapphire in your necklace carries this very meaning-standing for honor, sincerity, and intellect. In the eyes of the designer, CX330 is just like that gemstone: regal and wise, a beacon that inspires admiration from all wwho glimpse it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Studying Alexia&#39;s face with keen interest, the woman continued, &#34;The matching men&#39;s ring is called the Companion. It was made to stand beside and protect the star. Not every star needs a companion,though-CX330 shines just fine alone. Still, the Companion ring symbolizes a love that never fades. That&#39;s what the whole set means: loyal, silent devotion. Isn&#39;t that just the sweetest thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia, still caught off guard, nodded as she found her voice. &#34;It&#39;s beautiful-so romantic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a story of romance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Admiration filled the woman&#39;s tone as she added,&#34;When this set was revealed, collectors scrambled for it. The price went through the roof. Yet, the designer claimed it was truly one-of-a-kind-never to be sold. Instead, it spent years on display in a museum for the world to see. But today, seeing it worn by you feels like a stroke of luck!&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knowing grin appeared as she continued, &#34;If this necklace was a gift from a man, don&#39;t let the chance slip away! You ought to ask him about his feelings.Maybe he&#39;s cared about you far longer than you realize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt ran through Alexia&#39;s chest, her pulse thundering in her ears. She shook her head,trying to brush it off. &#34;No way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her protests, her gaze automatically swept the crowd, searching for any sign of Waylon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes found him at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even surrounded by admirers, Waylon&#39;s poise was unmistakable-cool, detached, every inch the nobleman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick apology escaped her lips. &#34;Sorry, please excuse me.&#34; She turned to head in his direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her steps started slow but quickly picked up speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a grating voice cut through the noise.&#34;Alexia, don&#39;t move another inch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words stopped Alexia in her tracks. She felt a chill settle over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she looked back, Roger&#39;s figure came into view.He wore a sleek suit, but there was a pale edge to his features. Marilee clung to him, her face drawn and full of complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill crept into Alexia&#39;s tone. &#34;So you managed to survive, Roger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sting of her words made Roger&#39;s cheeks flush.Coughing with irritation, he dropped his gaze. &#34;Are you that eager to see me gone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every eye in the room seemed drawn to Alexia that evening. Her radiance turned heads, and even Roger,ready to confront her, couldn&#39;t help but be caught off guard for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But suspicion clouded his mind. He wondered how someone without a job could afford such an elegant dress and the expensive jewelry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance flickered in his expression as he spat out,&#34;You could get in because you&#39;ve found yourself a rich man, huh? Are you that vain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Alexia retorted, &#34;Why is it any of your business? Shouldn&#39;t your focus be on wrapping up our divorce and finally making Marilee your wife, instead of keeping her in the shadows? At the rate you drag things out, Gibson Group is doomed under your watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color drained from Marilee&#39;s cheeks, while Roger&#39;s anger boiled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t deny it-Alexia wasn&#39;t the same woman she used to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gone was the quiet, accommodating wife. Now,every word she uttered seemed calculated to cut him to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments like this made Roger question everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of this fuss over an affair and a request for divorce? Did she truly despise him this much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She used to love him deeply. Was it possible for one betrayal to erase everything? Or was she simply acting out, hoping to keep his attention?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice chilled as he said, &#34;Our divorce isn&#39;t even official, and you&#39;re already scrambling for someone else. If you think being some man&#39;s plaything makes you special, you&#39;re just humiliating yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a determined look, he reached for Alexia&#39;s arm,intent on pulling her aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could lay a hand on her, a heavy slap forced him to recoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steely command sounded at her side. &#34;Don&#39;t lay a finger on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon had stepped up, standing solidly at Alexia&#39;s side.</p>
