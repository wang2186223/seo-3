                <p>&#34;Poor thing. Alexia has already been through enough, and now she&#39;s getting dragged even more. Some people just have the worst luck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as netizens started venting their outrage, the chat was suddenly flooded with warnings. &#34;Stop spreading slander or face legal consequences!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia noticed the ID clearly marked as part of Jenkins Group and let out a mocking smile. &#34;Looks like someone&#39;s getting nervous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curled into a cool, confident smile that caught everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, was that someone from Jenkins Group? So they were lurking this whole time? That&#39;s shady as hell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You all saw it, right? Jenkins Group said she&#39;s slandering Marilee. She&#39;s just bitter because they kicked her out, now she&#39;s making up lies!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down. Zayne&#39;s old application files were already found. They did list him as an International Math Competition gold medalist!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely unbothered, Alexia shot back, &#34;Go ahead and sue me. Let&#39;s see what lands first-your legal notice or my court summons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenkins Group&#39;s PR team clearly didn&#39;t expect Alexia to be so fearless. She wasn&#39;t backing down in the slightest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The live chat was practically on fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious that Jenkins Group had completely lost the upper hand in this public showdown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as the livestream kept heating up, Alexia&#39;s phone screen lit up with an incoming call from Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Alexia held it up for everyone to see, a sly smile tugging at her lips. &#34;Well, well, our ever-affectionate mother&#39;s on the line. Should I take this call live? What do you all think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The viewers flooded the chat, urging her to pick up. But before she could, Evelyn hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was fast. Did she get scared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course she&#39;s scared. A live call would&#39;ve been a total disaster for her. Gotta say, Alexia&#39;s smart for flipping the script.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She really knows what she&#39;s doing. She&#39;s playing this perfectly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that her makeup was done, Alexia looked flawless-her beauty and elegance had the whole chat mesmerized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave the camera a playful wink. &#34;That&#39;s all for today, folks. I&#39;ve got a few confrontations to take care of.I&#39;ll stream again when I can. Thank you for the generous tips, everything will go to charity after this. Bye!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a click, the stream ended, leaving viewers hooked and begging for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait! You can&#39;t just leave! I wanna hear the showdown too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The idea of Alexia walking into a showdown with the Jenkins family? I&#39;d pay to watch that happen live!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, at least post an update later! I need to know how it goes, even if it&#39;s just a text post!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The excitement hadn&#39;t even cooled before Alexia picked up her phone and returned Evelyn&#39;s call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn answered immediately, her voice sharp and angry.&#34;Alexia, if you have a problem, take it out on me.Why are you dragging Zayne into this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That tone-tight with fury-actually amused Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This so-called mother-no, foster mother-had spent over two decades treating her like a stranger. Cold,distant, emotionally unavailable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the day Alexia got married, Evelyn hadn&#39;t-so much as asked how she was doing. Not once. Even after they cut ties publicly, Evelyn never brought her name up, not even by accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now? All&#39; that icy composure melted away the moment Zayne got involved. How ironic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mocking laugh, Alexia said coolly, &#34;Take it out on you? Isn&#39;t that what I&#39;m already doing? Open your eyes. The more I go after Zayne, the more worked up you get. And when I humiliate him publicly,do you really think I&#39;m doing it to hurt Marilee? She&#39;s just collateral. It&#39;s you I&#39;m aiming at.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief pause on the line before Evelyn&#39;s voice returned-sharper this time, practically seething.&#34;We gave you everything for twenty years, and this is how you repay us? Aren&#39;t you afraid of the consequences of being so ungrateful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s hand slammed down on the table with a loud crack, making Evelyn jump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ungrateful?&#34; Alexia snapped. &#34;Do you even have the right to say that to me? You humiliated me in front of everyone at Marilee&#39;s birthday party-publicly disowned me without warning. Did you ever once stop to consider my feelings? No? Then why should I care about you guys now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn bit back, &#34;That still doesn&#39;t give you the right to go after Zayne! You promised me you&#39;d take this secret to the grave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia let out a dry laugh. &#34;And I only made that promise because you told me family scandals should stay private. But guess what? You aren&#39;t my family anymore. So why should I protect your lies? And besides,you promised me plenty of things too. Did you ever keep any of them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn had no response. The silence dragged on until her voice returned, cold as ever. &#34;Alexia, are you declaring war on us now?&#34;</p>
