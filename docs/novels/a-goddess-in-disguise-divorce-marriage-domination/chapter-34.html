                <p>Johann&#39;s eyes lit up with fervor. &#34;Mr. Mason, our project offers boundless potential. You&#39;d be wise to give it real consideration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon answered coolly, &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary.Alexia&#39;s decision is mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johann&#39;s face turned red with anger. He couldn&#39;t believe Waylon was actually listening to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does she even know? You&#39;re passing up a major opportunity because of her? Have you lost your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s eyes narrowed dangerously, but before she could speak, Waylon gently rested a hand on her shoulder. &#34;This is exactly why I don&#39;t waste time with you, Johann. You always bring nonsense with you.Alexia not just my companion and friend-she&#39;s someone I respect as a worthy rival. So tell me, what right do you have to bad-mouth her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johann stiffened, staring at Alexia in utter disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A worthy rival? Had he really heard that right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this woman truly be someone Waylon would place on equal footing? Was she really that capable?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johann&#39;s face twisted in annoyance, and he sneered.&#34;Mr. Mason, we have the finest minds and the most advanced scientific equipment. What could she possibly bring to the table?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia gave a sly smile. &#34;Advanced equipment? Oh,you mean the RA-1001? So, did you finally manage to find someone who knows how to use it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johann went ghostly pale, staring at Alexia like she&#39;d just revealed a dark secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How on earth did she know about one of their most guarded secrets?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three years earlier, someone delivered cutting-edge equipment to Blackcurrant Group, but it was too advanced for anyone to figure out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The machine was crucial to the Daylight Project.They came to Afoross hoping to find someone to unlock it. Whispers claimed its creator was an elusive genius from here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at Alexia now, Johann started to question if he&#39;d just offended someone way out of his league.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon gave a slight gesture to his bodyguard.&#34;Escort him out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguard stepped up and held out a hand.&#34;This way, Mr. Walsh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he didn&#39;t move on his own, they&#39;d have no problem tossing him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johann was stunned by the disrespect. &#34;Mr. Mason,your reputation for arrogance isn&#39;t exaggerated-you&#39;re as reckless as they say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today&#39;s rejection was a bitter pill he couldn&#39;t force down. Someday, they would regret treating him like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that bitter thought, Johann turned and walked out, refusing to look back as countless eyes followed his exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia turned to Waylon. &#34;You turned him down because you trust me, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I trust both you and myself,&#34; he replied calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia grinned and gave him a thumbs-up. &#34;Smart choice!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon stared at her and asked, &#34;Care to explain how you know about RA-1001?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My professor once mentioned it during a project.Blackcurrant Group has a messy past. Years ago,they invited him to a seminar, and he nearly didn&#39;t make it back,&#34; Alexia said with a sigh. &#34;He hasn&#39;t stepped out of the country since.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon narrowed his eyes. &#34;Anything else? Any other source of intel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way!&#34; Alexia blinked innocently. &#34;I&#39;ve just been an ordinary housewife for the last couple of years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon shot her a cold, cutting look. &#34;Maybe if you&#39;d used your brain, you wouldn&#39;t have been so easy to manipulate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t bring up those painful memories again,Mr.Mason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Mason, huh? I remember you called me Wally not long ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That comment caught her off guard, and for a brief second, her composure slipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the auction began, both of them took their seats in the center of the VIP section.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far behind, Marilee and Roger entered and found seats a few rows back. After Roger lost the drinking challenge, Marilee had tried to persuade him to go to the hospital, but he stubbornly refused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Roger, this wasn&#39;t just about losing a game-it was about losing face, and worse, losing the gambling license the Gibson family had always assumed was theirs. If he walked out now, the whole of Afoross Would say Waylon had sent him packing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t stomach that kind of disgrace. Not now.Not ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pale-faced and brooding, Roger stared holes into the pair seated ahead of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auctioneer was already introducing the first item,but Roger barely heard a word. All he could see was Alexia, seated beside Waylon like nothing had ever happened. The sight made his blood boil.&#34;Unbelievable,&#34; he muttered bitterly. &#34;She used to swear she hated him, and now she&#39;s all over him.Liar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee let out a soft, smug laugh and gently patted his arm. &#34;Don&#39;t waste your anger on someone like her. She&#39;s born to climb ladders. Nothing she says ever means anything.&#34;</p>
