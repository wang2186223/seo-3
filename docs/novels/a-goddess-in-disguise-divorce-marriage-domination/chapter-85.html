                <p>Ada scanned the message and nearly let out a laugh right then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She weighed her response for a good minute before sending anything back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, Waylon&#39;s got his eye on you-that&#39;s a major plus! You could totally reel him in. Guys that good-looking are made for a little harmless flirting,especially when it&#39;s Waylon we&#39;re talking about.Whoever ends up with him will have bragging rights forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia retorted, &#34;You&#39;re impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be real-with a face and body like his, you&#39;re not even a little tempted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That comment made Alexia pause. Her mind wandered for just a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of being with him didn&#39;t seem so outrageous after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she was lost in that thought, a new notification lit up her phone-Waylon&#39;s name on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suddenness made her fumble, almost sending her phone flying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she pulled up the chat, she saw that Waylon had dropped a file on Leif Saunders-one of the thugs that had kidnapped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short message followed. &#34;Leif cracked during last night&#39;s questioning.Marilee&#39;s the one who ordered the kidnapping. All the proof is in your inbox. What you do now is up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attached to the message were a handful of photos and a damning audio file.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a tap, Alexia listened as Leif&#39;s terrified voice broke down, his confession spilling out between panicked screams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage simmered beneath Alexia&#39;s skin. She&#39;d suspected Marilee&#39;s involvement ever since the Black Tiger Gang grabbed her, but hearing the full admission made her blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee hadn&#39;t been satisfied stirring up a mob on social media-she&#39;d gone so far as to hire criminals to have her kidnapped. If she hadn&#39;t managed to escape or if Waylon hadn&#39;t shown up when he did,the outcome would have been unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going to spare her this time.&#34; Alexia&#39;s lips curled in contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Jenkins family clearly hadn&#39;t learned their lesson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tapped her fingers on the wheel, shifted gears,and floored it toward the Gibson family&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Gibson family was in uproar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa, you can&#39;t let this slide! Waylon has crossed every line!&#34; Brandon sobbed, clutching Allen&#39;s leg in a desperate plea. Allen&#39;s gaze landed on his grandson&#39;s bandaged hand, and his heart twisted with pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon had spent the night in the hospital after losing two fingers; now, newly discharged, he was determined to get justice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Allen first learned what had happened, the shock and fury nearly knocked him off his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s eyes flashed with anger, though her words came out cold. &#34;You had it coming. Maybe now you&#39;ll think twice before sneaking off to those casinos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria&#39;s expression soured instantly. &#34;Eleanor, how can you be so heartless? This is all on Waylon. No matter how many times Brandon messes up, he had no right to go that far! It&#39;s a direct insult to our family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen&#39;s gaze darkened as he turned to Roger, who stood quietly by. His anger spilled over.&#34;Why are you just standing there? You were present, weren&#39;t you?Why didn&#39;t you stand up to Waylon and defend Brandon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s eyes flicked to Brandon, who sat weeping on the floor. &#34;Brandon started the trouble. And besides,Waylon showed up with numbers on his side. What was I supposed to do-fight a losing battle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s voice cracked, wounded. &#34;Roger! How can you say that? If you&#39;d just gotten on your knees before Alexia, I wouldn&#39;t have lost mny fingers!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words barely left his mouth before Roger snapped, his composure fracturing. His usually calm face hardened as he jabbed a finger at Brandon.&#34;Why should I kneel for you? I just bailed you out of a five hundred million debt, and now there&#39;s a one-billion charge waiting at mny company! You expect me to pay for your messes and beg for mercy too? When will you take responsibility for yourself, Brandon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s rare outburst stunned everyone. Suddenly,the entire hall fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment hardened Eleanor&#39;s features as she fixed Brandon with a withering glare. &#34;Another billion in debt, Brandon? Are you set on driving the Gibson family into the ground?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s frustration exploded. &#34;Isn&#39;t it enough I&#39;ve lost my fingers? Must you keep piling on the blame?Would you only be satisfied if I was dead? This time I was the victim and our whole family got humiliated,but all you care about is the money! You claim I&#39;m sinking the family, but when I&#39;m in trouble, not a single one of you steps up! Even Alexia has Waylon fighting her battles. What use is family if you all turn your backs on me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tirade jolted Allen from his silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his patience with Brandon had worn thin,Waylon&#39;s treatment of the family gnawed at his pride.He took a heavy breath. &#34;Brandon may have made mistakes, but Waylon&#39;s disrespect cannot go unanswered. I&#39;m going to visit the Mason family and demand justice!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was halfway to his feet when the doors flew open and Alexia swept into the living room,her presence sharp as a blade. &#34;Demand justice? That&#39;s funny-l came here with a list of grievances myself!&#34;</p>
