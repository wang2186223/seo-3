                <p>In the video, Marilee played the ideal victim, who had lost everything and was now bravely trying to get her life back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the interview wrapped up, the reporter delivered the question everyone had been waiting for.&#34;Do you hate her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee looked straight into the camera, paused for a long time, then wiped her tears and quietly said, rather not answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, the internet lit up like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marilee is way too soft. If someone stole my life for twenty years, I&#39;d be out for revenge!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That other woman is disgusting. If Marilee hadn&#39;t stood up, that fake would still be enjoying the rich life that wasn&#39;t hers!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does anyone know where Alexia&#39;s really from? I heard she was raised in the slums-no surprise there.Places like that only turn out garbage. She&#39;s just a rat that clawed her way out of the gutter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s a teacher at Afoross now? You&#39;ve got to be kidding. A school like that hiring her? We should start a protest!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee&#39;s fan club didn&#39;t waste time. They launched a campaign with the hashtag #ProtectTheRealPrincess,filling social media with hate aimed at Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things only got worse. Gossip pages, bloggers, and online news kept spreading the story in different ways.But the main idea stayed-everyone felt sorry for Marilee and wondered why Alexia was even in the picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada sounded worried on the phone. &#34;Alexia, my brother&#39;s trying to shut this story down right now. Marilee set this up for sure-she probably has fake accounts making it go viral.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia stayed calm. &#34;If we shut it down now, she&#39;ll just say rich people are trying to hide the truth. This going viral means she has more planned. I&#39;ll wait and gather proof. Let her make the next move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada exhaled sharply. &#34;I&#39;m seriously worried. Her fans are ruthless. Have you seen the stuff they&#39;re saying?Some of those comments have gone viral. I couldn&#39;t even finish reading them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia spoke without hesitation. &#34;Calm down. Bad press still puts me on the radar. If she wants to give me free publicity, I&#39;d be a fool not to take it. You should focus on your job and try looking at things that won&#39;t make your blood boil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada let out a frustrated sigh, but deep down, she was a little amazed at how unbothered Alexia seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding her phone back into her coat pocket, Alexia turned and walked toward the classrooms, only to bump into Brandon, who was sweaty and carrying a basketball.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? You&#39;re actually showing up here?&#34; Brandon gave her a once-over, smirking. &#34;If I were you, l&#39;d be hiding under my bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon was the type who loved watching drama from the sidelines. With the scandals blowing up online,seeing Alexia get roasted was pure entertainment to him. He couldn&#39;t stop liking every hateful comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia didn&#39;t even blink. &#34;And what&#39;s any of this got to do with you? You barely got into this university on an athletic scholarship, almost failed out because of your grades, and let&#39;s not even talk about the gambling debt that nearly got you expelled. And you think I should be embarrassed? If it weren&#39;t for your grandfather crawling to the board and begging them to give you another chance, you&#39;d have been long gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s face turned red, and he retorted, &#34;You act all high and mighty, but don&#39;t forget that you were the fake the Jenkins family kicked out. Even my brother didn&#39;t want you. If I wasn&#39;t feeling nice, I&#39;d have called campus security to drag you off already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia stepped forward, looking down at him with calm authority. &#34;Be my guest. Let&#39;s see who security sides with-a student on probation or a faculty member?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon stared at her, then snorted. &#34;You? A faculty member? What do you do-serve food in the cafeteria?Hand out trays?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could reply, a calm male voice came from behind. &#34;Ms. Jenkins, there you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s shoulders tensed. He turned and went completely still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall guy in a black hoodie walked toward them, backlit by the sun. His presence practically demanded attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan Hayes?&#34; Brandon was shocked. The campus genius-brilliant, reclusive, and nearly mythical.Most students only heard his name, not saw him. And now here he was, heading their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he was actually talking to Alexia with respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, was she really a teacher here? No way! That couldn&#39;t be right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon just stood there, stunned, as Nolan walked right past him and stood next to Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Alexia looked a bit caughtoff guard.&#34;Oh, it&#39;s you? Didn&#39;t expect to run into you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan gave a subtle smile. &#34;Not quite a coincidence. I came to find you.&#34;</p>
