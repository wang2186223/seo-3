                <p>&#34;Tell me, Brandon, do you honestly believe the Gibson family still holds all the strings? After losing your gambling license in Griffinham, your grandfather has been hobnobbing at every banquet, hoping to secure the west city project. Imagine what might happen if this recording and the bid file reached the officials at the exact same time. Think your family would even make it to the bidding round?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words struck Brandon like a flash of lightning, his eyes going wide with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization of what she knew sent a wave of cold sweat down his back. &#34;That&#39;s not possible...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s lips curled into a sly grin. &#34;Is something wrong? Are you feeling nervous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swallowing nervously, Brandon couldn&#39;t comprehend how a teacher like her knew so much about his family&#39;s affairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every rival his family ever made seemed to flicker in his memory. If this scandal blew up and wrecked the bidding plan...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shut the thought down before it could go further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Brandon still rattled, Alexia pressed her advantage. &#34;Lost your nerve? Think I&#39;m bluffing? That&#39;s fine.I&#39;m happy to run an experiment. Let&#39;s see who ends up losing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to steady his shaking hands, Brandon took a breath. &#34;Please, I was just joking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t dare to push her any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, he understood just how serious things could get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small shake of the head accompanied Alexia&#39;s next words. &#34;Not much of a joke, was it? You threatened a teacher today. I can&#39;t just let that go. What&#39;s your plan for making it up to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a stiff voice, Brandon forced out an apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s expression never softened. &#34;You owe your real apology to someone else. Who did you hurt most?Apologize to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tillie looked up, startled. She hadn&#39;t expected anyone to fight her corner with such determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause and some visible discomfort, Brandon finally muttered out an apology to Tillie. Alexia remained unimpressed. &#34;Say it loud enough for everyone to hear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what is that? Are you glued to the spot? If you&#39;re really sorry, show some respect and bow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon gritted his teeth, his fists clenched tightly, but under Alexia&#39;s imposing presence, he lowered his head and bowed to Tillie. &#34;I&#39;m sorry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not content, Alexia continued her critique. &#34;You call that a bow? Bend lower, or it doesn&#39;t count.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon&#39;s forehead was tight with effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could grumble, Alexia added, &#34;It&#39;s alright if you can&#39;t manage it. You&#39;ll get a front-row seat when your grandfather has to bow to the officials next time. Take notes from him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word she spoke dripped with mockery and warning, leaving Brandon feeling utterly defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to meet anyone&#39;s gaze, he hunched over even more, voice cracking as he yelled, &#34;I&#39;m sorry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their argument quickly drew a crowd, though Tillie seemed frozen in fear. Alexia, unfazed, let out a cold laugh. &#34;Give me your phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitation flickered across Brandon&#39;s face before he finally surrendered his unlocked phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia scrolled through his gallery, erasing every photo of Tillie that crossed the line and clearing out any hidden backups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finished, she tossed the phone back to him, her stare cold. &#34;If you ever bother Tillie again or try to blackmail her, the Gibson family&#39;s reputation will be the first to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That warning lingered as she took Tillie by the arm and walked away, leaving Brandon standing alone,crushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they left the basketball court, Tillie couldn&#39;t hold back her tears any longer. &#34;Thank you,Ms.Jenkins.I wouldn&#39;t have known what to do without you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s hand landed gently on her shoulder, her words kinder now. &#34;You don&#39;t have to be scared. If anything like this happens again, go straight to a teacher or the office. Never try to handle it all by yourself, alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears still glistening on her cheeks, Tillie managed a nod. &#34;I get it now. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile curved on Alexia&#39;s lips.&#34;Good. Make sure you grab a meal before you go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will do! See you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Tillie hurried away, relief settled over Alexia. A quick glance at her watch made her realize she was running behind for lunch with Waylon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasted no time and picked up her pace, heading straight for the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back on the court, realization finally hit Brandon. Though the photos were wiped from his phone, he had overlooked one thing-the recording still remained on Alexia&#39;s device.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could such an obvious detail slip his mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold sweat broke out as he wondered what Alexia might do with that evidence. She could hold it over him or even threaten the Gibson family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven by panic, Brandon smacked his forehead and dashed off, determined to catch up with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the parking garage, Alexia was unlocking her car, reaching for the door, when an unfamiliar sound caught her attention. Instead of the usual hum of engines, faint whispers curled through the concrete, echoing softly through the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instincts on high alert, she spun around, but nothing met her eyes-just empty shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a familiar voice bounced off the garage walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of her name cut through the stillness, unmistakable and urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up, Alexia spotted Brandon sprinting in her direction, closing the distance with every step.</p>
