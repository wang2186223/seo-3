            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>The stunned silence didn&#39;t last long. Within seconds, the room burst into loud protests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s completely lost it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liam Whitmore, did all that studying melt your brain? What happened to basic decency?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What good is science if it doesn&#39;t serve everyone? Is it just some toy for the elite?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The uproar swelled until Alexia tapped the lectern. Her voice didn&#39;t rise; it was calm and firm. &#34;That&#39;s enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d met people like Liam before-brilliant minds, always two steps ahead in thought, yet blind to the emotions and realities of others. Cold brilliance, she called it. Dangerous when left unchecked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she didn&#39;t see him as a lost cause. He was gifted, no doubt about that. But talent without empathy?That kind of brilliance burned itself out, fast and ugly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him and said calmly,&#34;Liam,tell me something-how do you define the weak?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Poverty. Ignorance. Arrogance,&#34; he said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia nodded. &#34;Fair enough. But what makes you so sure you&#39;re not one of them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, but the words didn&#39;t come right away.&#34;1&#34;mnot,&#34; he said after a pause. &#34;Not compared to them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe not,&#34; Alexia said, her voice even. &#34;Getting into Afoross University means you&#39;ve already outpaced most people. But there&#39;s always someone smarter, better. Let&#39;s say we put you in a room full of the smartest people alive. Where do you think you&#39;d rank then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s confidence flickered. He didn&#39;t answer. Alexia leaned on the lectern, eyes sweeping across the classroom.&#34;Everything&#39;s relative-wealth, power, status, even intelligence. Your position can change the moment your surroundings change. One day you&#39;re at the top, the next you&#39;re not even on the map.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her voice deepened, each word landing with clarity. &#34;Ethics aren&#39;t a roadblock to progress. They&#39;re what keep progress from becoming destruction. Without boundaries, science can strip away dignity,ruin the environment, and tear apart society. Innovation without understanding leads nowhere. We don&#39;t just push science forward. We have to think about what it leaves behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence returned, but this time, it held weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was the first to applaud. A second later, the other students snapped out of their daze as a wave of thunderous clapping followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the end of class, Alexia had completely won them over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Students swarmed her, eager to talk, ask questions, and simply be near someone who made science feel like more than facts and formulas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Jenkins is the full package-smart, stunning, and real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Best class I&#39;ve taken. She actually mnakes science make sense. Finally! God, we&#39;ve had our fill of those dull,lifeless lectures. She&#39;s the best thing to happen to this department.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those trolls are clueless. &#39;Fake daughter&#39;? Please. She&#39;s thoughtful, sharp, and kind. Unlike Marilee,who just rides her fame and manipulates the narrative whenever it suits her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Marilee is basically a walking PR campaign. With all that money backing her, she sells the &#39;perfect girl next door&#39; image like she&#39;s clocking in for work. I can&#39;t stand the fake act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan listened as the praise flew around him, eyes resting on Alexia still surrounded by students. Only then did he let out a quiet breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around lunch, he approached and invited her to join him and Damon. She smiled, but gently turned him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his.head as she gathered her things. &#34;Got plans?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small nod while closing her notebook. &#34;Yeah. My lunches are booked all week.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Busy social life,&#34; he said, narrowing his eyes playfully.&#34;Friend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not quite.&#34; She hesitated, trying to explain the strange mess her connection with Waylon had become.&#34;More like a headache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked, then laughed.&#34;A headache?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia gave a small shrug. &#34;Yeah. He&#39;s arrogant. One minute he keeps his distance; the next he&#39;s suddenly there, dragging you into something. He&#39;s exhausting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you hate him?&#34; Nolan asked, like it was a casual thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand froze halfway through zipping her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught her pause and smiled knowingly. &#34;Didn&#39;t think so. Doesn&#39;t sound like hate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised an eyebrow. &#34;You think you know me that well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Educated guess. And since you&#39;re all booked up this week, I&#39;m claiming your time for Prof. Ellis next week.&#34;Nolan gave her a playful wave and wandered off, content with her nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving campus, Alexia pulled out her phone and scrolled through the flood of online chatter. Her name was everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, just a little. And she wasn&#39;t about to let free publicity go to waste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a few minutes, she had official, verified accounts across all major platforms. Her first post went up without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two-faced? Gold digger? Scheming bitch? I&#39;ve heard worse. Twenty years playing the perfect understudy -no one does &#39;fake daughter&#39; better than me. Curious about my side? Catch my live stream tonight at 8.Don&#39;t miss it.&#34;</p>
