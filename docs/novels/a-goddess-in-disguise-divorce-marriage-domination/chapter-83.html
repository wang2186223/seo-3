                <p>Korbin shook his head. Waylon and Alexia? Had they really buried the hatchet that quickly? Gone from sworn enemies to some kind of tender, intimate duo in the blink of an eye? That didn&#39;t sound like Waylon at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin&#39;s thoughts were spiraling into wild speculation when the sound of footsteps descending the staircase snapped him out of his daze.He looked up-and there Alexia was, draped in soft loungewear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin&#39;s eyes nearly bulged from their sockets. No way-Waylon&#39;s mysterious love interest was actually her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy shit, it&#39;s really you?&#34; Korbin blurted, springing off the couch in sheer disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia froze, stared at him for three tense seconds,then wordlessly turned on her heel and strode back upstairs without a glance more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin stood rooted to the spot, baffled.&#34;Hey-wait!Why are you leaving? Where&#39;s Waylon? Didn&#39;t he spend the night with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexia didn&#39;t so much as flinch. Her pace quickened as she made her retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway up, she crossed paths with Waylon, who was just descending. Her expression tightened slightly as she leaned in and asked under her breath, &#34;Where are the clothes I changed out of yesterday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They were ruined. Obviously, I tossed them,&#34; Waylon replied matter-of-factly. &#34;I&#39;ve already ordered replacements-they&#39;ll be delivered soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia bit her lower lip.&#34;Oh...okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made to hurry past him, but Waylon reached out,catching her by the arm with a frown. &#34;What&#39;s the rush?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Korbin&#39;s downstairs. He might&#39;ve gotten the wrong idea about us. You should probably go explain.&#34; With that,she pulled her arm free and disappeared into her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, Korbin watched Waylon approach and slung an arm over his shoulder. &#34;Unbelievable! You finally get together with her and don&#39;t even give your best friend a heads-up? That&#39;s cold, man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon brushed him off coolly and gestured for a servant to bring two cups of coffee. &#34;Don&#39;t overthink it. She was kidnapped last night, got injured, and stayed here to recover. That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Korbin&#39;s expression shifted from curiosity to concern. &#34;Who was behind it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s eyes darkened. &#34;Black Tiger Gang.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those bastards again.&#34; Korbin let out a low wvhistle and dropped onto the sofa. &#34;Their old backer was Dane Warren, and you already wiped out his whole faction. And yet they still have the guts to make a move on someone close to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon remained composed. &#34;Just because Dane fell doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t others. Black Tiger Gang&#39;s survival never hinged on one backer alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Dane&#39; empire collapsed, it left behind a vacuum,and opportunists had rushed in to claim what they could. The Black Tiger Gang was just a blade hired by whoever paid the most. And as long as they remained useful, someone would keep swinging them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin read between the lines, his brow furrowing.&#34;They&#39;ve had their claws in the entertainment industry for decades. It&#39;s been their playground. Sure, they&#39;re just thugs, but rooting them out completely won&#39;t be easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon offered a faint smile, one laced with menace.&#34;They&#39;re more useful as bait-draw out the bigger players behind them. But first, they need a reminder of who they&#39;re dealing with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;reminder&#34; made Korbin tense. He was a soldier. His way of handling threats was blunt and direct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Waylon was a politician. A politician&#39;s tactics could be more lethal than a blade, more poisonous than a vial of cyanide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when Waylon said &#34;reminder,&#34; Korbin knew things wouldn&#39;t stop at the Black Tiger Gang. The ripples would spread, sweeping in others, and the blood wouldn&#39;t just be theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his friend&#39;s grim silence, Waylon took a measured sip of coffee. &#34;So,what brought you here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin snapped back to the present. &#34;I&#39;ve been assigned to an overseas counterterrorism mission.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s gaze sharpened. &#34;And your grandfather approved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Douglas family had built a legacy across three generations of decorated soldiers. Korbin&#39;s grandfather was a legend-a name etched into military history. And as his only grandson, Korbin had long been groomed to carry that torch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after Korbin&#39;s father&#39;s sudden death, the old man had nearly pulled Korbin out of the military altogether just to protect what remained of the line</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin had refused,though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He met Waylon&#39;s gaze, eyes steady. &#34;If I just coast on my family&#39;s name, what would our legacy even mean?Soldiers prove themselves through battle, not lineage.I&#39;ve waited long enough. The world shifts fast. And sometimes, all it takes is a word from people like you to redraw the board.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon arched a brow. &#34;That&#39;s quite the criticism.I didn&#39;trealize you held such dim views about our friendship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin smiled faintly. &#34;I&#39;m only saying it because trust you. My family needs to rise further. My grandfather&#39;s cautious now-too cautious. But every family faces that moment. You either advance or become obsolete. And a militaryfamily without victories is nothing more than a broken gun.&#34;</p>
