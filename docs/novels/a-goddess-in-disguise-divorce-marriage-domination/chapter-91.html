                <p>Watching the scene unfold; Roger hesitated, his hands balling and relaxing as he wrestled with his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Alexia was about to turn and walk out, he finally gathered his resolve and called after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;l go along with your conditions,&#34; Roger said,drawing in a shaky breath. &#34;But you have to promise this ends here. You can&#39;t come after them again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia paused, her gaze sharpening. After a beat, she gave a nod that sounded almost genuine. &#34;Agreed.As long as they stay out of my way, they&#39;ll never hear from me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria, not ready to accept defeat, opened her mouth to protest, but Eleanor squeezed her hand tightly.&#34;Unless you want this to blow up even worse for our family,you&#39;ll keep quiet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria snapped her mouth shut, simmering with frustration, but knowing she&#39;d never had much pull in the Gibson family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee chewed her lip, shrinking closer to Roger,forced to listen as he and Alexia ironed out the final terms of the divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s tone left no room for negotiation. &#34;Since we&#39;re clear that Roger leaves with nothing,there&#39;s nothing left to discuss. My lawyer will prepare the agreement, and you&#39;ll sign it. Be at the courthouse by nine tomorrow. If you&#39;re late, I can&#39;t promise I won&#39;t take action you&#39;ll regret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee&#39;s resentment boiled over at those words.Alexia was insufferable! Why had the Black Tiger Gang botched the job? She cursed Dina for promising it would all be handled seamlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had bought Dina&#39;s empty promises, and now Alexia stood poised to walk away with every last one of Roger&#39;s assets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the Gibson family&#39;s residence, Alexia called her lawyel:.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lawyer sounded stunned by the request. &#34;Roger actually agreed to walk away with nothing? I was bracing for a brawl with his lawyer. How did you pull that off,Alexia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s tone was light, almost amused. &#34;Honestly, I barely had to do anything-his girlfriend and cousin did the work for me. Just focus on getting that agreement finished and send it over tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You got it. I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re more than satisfied with the agreement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Appreciate it. Let&#39;s catch up for lunch sometime soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a sharp royal blue suit, the lawyer leaned over her office window, watching the swirl of traffic and grinned. &#34;Why not tomorrow? Once you&#39;re free of that marriage, we&#39;ll throw you a party.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia faltered. &#34;You think that&#39;s necessary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely! Kicking a loser to the curb is cause for champagne and celebration. That&#39;s settled. I&#39;ll text you the plans. Make sure you bring Ada-I haven&#39;t seen her in ages.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she cheerfully ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia smiled to herself, shaking her head. After all this time, her friend hadn&#39;t changed-still fearless,still delightfully outrageous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the cafe beside the courthouse the following morning, Roger showed up before she did. He flipped through the agreement in silence, face set in stone,and signed without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the woman sitting across from him-so distant, so unyielding-and a strange wave of confusion washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind wandered back two years, to the day they&#39;d made it official. Alexia&#39;s face had held no hint of today&#39;s chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered sunshine spilling through the windows. She&#39;d been waiting in a white dress, the cafe buzzing around her, a picture of quiet grace in the middle of chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Roger walked in, she&#39;d caught his eye immediately. Something about her presence that day -poised and mesmerizing-stood out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled how sour his mood had been. He hadn&#39;t planned to be gentle. But when she looked up and smiled, he&#39;d felt a fleeting urge to see where things might go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get this over with.&#34; Alexia&#39;s voice snapped him out of the memory, cool and businesslike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger simply nodded, a flicker of awkwardness crossing his face as he returned the agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, they exited the cafe, keeping distance between them. Only after the last formality at the courthouse was complete did Alexia finally exhale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could finally breathe. The nightmare of their marriage was at last behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving Roger a backward glance, Alexia pivoted and strode toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger watched her retreat, a restless discomfort gnawing at him as she moved further away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia!&#34; he called out, his voice echoing through the hall and drawing a few curious glances, yet she didn&#39;t so much as flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not once did she glance over her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving the courthouse behind, Alexia put Roger&#39;s voice-and all that came with it-in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped into sunlight, clouds drifting lazily across a wide blue sky. Eyes half-closed, she felt a peacefulness she hadn&#39;t known in ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Today isn&#39;t the only good day-tomorrow looks bright,too.&#34;</p>
