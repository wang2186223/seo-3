                <p>Brandon&#39;s grip tightened on the weapon, and he swung the barrel toward Alexia without the slightest hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Malice glinted in his eyes. &#34;Don&#39;t put this on me.You&#39;re the reason I&#39;m tangled up in all this. If you&#39;re angry, save it for whoever set this trap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squeezed the trigger. In a blur of motion, Alexia shoved the scar-faced man in front of her, the bullet punching through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gasp, the scar-faced man crashed to the floor,his body landing hard in front of the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had he fallen than the skinny thug lunged forward,snatching the gun from Brandon&#39;s stunned hand,and barreled after Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lead whined through the air as bullets pinged off metal beams, orange sparks slicing past Alexia&#39;s side The gunman&#39;s shouts and wild curses bounced through the empty warehouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick check of her magazine revealed two rounds remaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would have to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wiping grime from her brow, Alexia scanned the space and spotted a half-open steel cabinet twenty meters away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boots pounded closer from the northwest, their precise rhythm hinting at military discipline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yanked the ancient breaker from the wall,copper wires exposed, and let them scrape against a nearby pin. Electricity sizzled as sparks flared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bald pursuer charged in, but Alexia reacted first,kicking the tangle of live wires straight at him. Metal met copper with a jolt; high voltage shot through his body, sending him convulsing to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Death claimed him in a matter of seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A howl of rage tore from the skinny thug as he watched his companion&#39;s ggrisly fate. Fury overtook him,and he hurled a steel pipe toward Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sidestepped the attack, leveling her pistol and squeezing off a shot in reply</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frantic warning burst from Brandon.&#34;Watch out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reacting to the shout, the skinny man jerked his head aside just in time for the bullet to graze his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shriek erupted, panic overtaking bravado.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for Brandon&#39;s call, Alexia&#39;s shot would have been lethal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia gave Brandon a frosty glare, mouth curling into a cold,mocking sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come out, coward!&#34; The thug&#39;s voice was ragged with fear and fury. &#34;You think you can hide forever?I know that gun only has one round left! When you&#39;re out, I&#39;ll be waiting, and you&#39;ll beg for mercy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at the long shadow she cast on the wall,Alexia recalled her teacher&#39;s words. With a single bullet left,she had to become that bullet. Defeat wasn&#39;t an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crouching behind a barricade of barrels, Alexia grabbed a stray wooden stick and tossed it left.Predictably, the skinny thug&#39;s aim shifted,gun tracking the noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved in a heartbeat. Both pistols fired, and her foot lashed out, kicking the weapon from his hand The sound of a bullet ripping through flesh mingled with the heavy thud of broken ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain ripped through the skinny man as he crashed to the floor, hacking and gasping, only to realize his foot was bleeding, a bullet having torn straight through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Movement was impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration spilled out in a fist pounding the concrete.&#34;Damn it!&#34; he spat, fury and humiliation etched on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a cunning woman!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing her opening, Alexia sprinted for the exit,determination etched into every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes narrowed, the skinny man slipped a dagger from his pocket and tossed it toward Brandon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was their last chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brandon paused, torn by doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet as he considered Alexia&#39;s fierce and stubborn spirit, he realized with a sinking feeling that if she managed to slip away now, it would only be a matter of time before she returned to hunt him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it would mark his complete and utter downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dread settling in his gut, he snatched up the blade and tore off after Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Alexia darted into the open, scanning frantically. Her gaze landed on a white car, tucked away in the shadows of the corner lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her, footsteps thudded urgently against the pavement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spinning around, she found herself facing Brandon&#39;s crazed eyes and the gleam of a dagger driving straight for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wildness had seized him. &#34;You&#39;re not getting away this time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gunshot cracked through the night, sharp and sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One bullet found its mark in Brandon&#39;s wrist. The knife clattered to the ground as he howled, collapsing in agony. &#34;My hand! You&#39;ve ruined my hand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood mingled with the cold night air, the metallic scent thick between them. Alexia&#39;s instincts kicked in;she whirled to see Waylon, radiating icy fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within seconds, agents swept in and pinned Brandon to the ground. Simon stood to the side,eyes flicking to Waylon, surprise flickering in his usually unreadable gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Korbin, such violence would have been expected; he had been raised on military tradition,hardened by a life at the front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Waylon&#39;s place was in the polished halls of the elite. He was revered for his composure, a man others looked up to for his calm and unshakable grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever he desired it, there were countless individuals eager to carry out his most unsavory tasks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, when it came to Alexia, he found himself willing to bend his own rules and grant her a rare exception.</p>
