                <p>&#34;That nanny&#39;s temper is downright vicious. Poor Betsey-so soft, so fragile-she couldn&#39;t even get her injured cat to a vet. Honestly, how she endures that environment every day is beyond me,&#34; Alexia said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message couldn&#39;t have been more obvious Serena,quick on the uptake, recalled the uncertainty in Betsey&#39;s voice from earlier. Rage simmered beneath her calm. &#34;Thank you for letting me know. I&#39;ll deal with this personally. Appreciate it, Alexia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No trouble at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the call disconnected, Chloe exploded. She lunged at Alexia with all the fury of someone unhinged. &#34;You cost me my job, you bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexia&#39;s reflexes were swift. Chloe&#39;s wrist was caught in an iron grip, then forced backward with brutal efficiency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cry of pain ripped from Chloe&#39;s lips as she collapsed to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsey recoiled, eyes wide. Alexia, her expression like ice, looked down at the woman sprawled in agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ada, get security up here. Let them know there&#39;s been a break-in and I&#39;ve been attacked. Have this woman thrown out and barred from the property for good. If they hesitate, I&#39;ll call the police myself. She doesn&#39;t own an apartment here, yet she stormed in and tried to attack me. I doubt Newhall Garden wants that stain on their reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada sprang into action, her voice edged with disdain.&#34;She&#39;s lucky all you&#39;re doing is calling security. People like her forget where they stand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mocking smile curved Ada&#39;s lips as she added, &#34;At your age, your own kids must be grown by now.Where do they work, I wonder? Which companies? No answer? That&#39;s fine-I&#39;ll dig it up myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe finally seemed to realize the gravity of her actions.Fear replaced anger. &#34;Please! I lost control! It wasn&#39;t on purpose! Don&#39;t punish my children for my mistake. I&#39;m begging you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s smirk was merciless. &#34;Oh, now you&#39;re frightened? Maybe you should&#39;ve thought about that before mistreating someone else&#39;s child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe fell silent, stricken with dread. Security soon arrived, wasted no time, and escorted her off the premises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security staff rushed over,bowing their heads with  apologies. &#34;Please forgive us for what happened,ladies. We&#39;ll be stepping up patrols to make sure nothing like this ever occurs again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her attention to Betsey, Alexia spoke gently.&#34;Head home now. I&#39;ll handle getting the cat checked out. Once it&#39;s all healed, you and your mom can come collect it together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears shimmered in Betsey&#39;s eyes, gratitude written across her delicate features. &#34;Thank you so much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Betsey safely sent off, Alexia and Ada carried the injured cat straight to the vet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the ride over, Ada fumed, unable to let go of her anger. &#34;That wasn&#39;t any accident. I&#39;d bet anything that woman chucked the poor thing off the balcony.Cosmo Biotech, I know the name. The girl&#39;s mom must be Serena Adams. Who&#39;d believe someone like her-such a powerhouse-could be fooled by someone so despicable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A puzzled look crossed Alexia&#39;s face. &#34;Serena Adams is really that important?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Absolutely. There aren&#39;t many women who&#39;ve built their own empires in this business,but she did it. The whole Adams family is still standing because of her. Prof. Ellis&#39;s lab is even slated to collaborate with them on future projects.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia grew quiet, mulling over Ada&#39;s words-right as her phone began to ring. Waylon&#39;s name lit up her screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you right now?&#34; Waylon asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m heading to the hospital,&#34; Alexia replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her answer was barely out before Waylon&#39;s concern came through, sharper than before. &#34;Are you hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick glance at the ginger cat curled up in the pet carrier, Alexia reassured him, &#34;Not me-a cat.I&#39;m taking it to the vet. What&#39;s going on? Is there something you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment of silence stretched between them,almost as if Waylon had let out a sigh of relief. &#34;It&#39;s fine. Take care of your cat for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia didn&#39;t let it slide. &#34;Hold on. You wouldn&#39;t have called if there wasn&#39;t something up. Out with it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the driver&#39;s seat, Ada glanced over, clearly intrigued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s next words carried a soft, husky undertone that made his smooth voice even more captivating.&#34;It&#39;s nothing urgent. I&#39;m in the middle of making glazed ribs and hit a wall. Figured you could help me out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he be serious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one could deny that Alexia&#39;s glazed ribs were unforgettable-tender, rich, with just the right blend of sweetness and tang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, for someone like Waylon-who could summon a Michelin chef with a single call-to need help in the kitchen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock registered first for Alexia, realizing he was actually cooking. But then, concern replaced surprise as she picked up on the roughness in his voice. &#34;You sound off. Are you sick? Did you run a fever and forget to take something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet,&#34; Waylon replied casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why haven&#39;t you taken anything?&#34; Alexia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A trace of stubbornness colored his answer. &#34;Because I want glazed ribs, and nothing else will do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s mind flashed back to the favor she still owed,and resignation crept in. &#34;Alright, you win. Don&#39;t lay a finger on anything else. I&#39;ll get there as soon as I can!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended, and Alexia turned to Ada with a sheepish grin. &#34;Ada, could you drop the cat at the vet  for me? I&#39;ll swing by as soon as I handle this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ada let out a long sigh. &#34;Sure. It&#39;s not like anyone tells Waylon no. But honestly-are you even aware that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered in Alexia&#39;s eyes. &#34;What are you trying to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon was clearly making a move on Alexia. Though the words hovered on her tongue, Ada thought better of voicing them. Some things were just better left unspoken.</p>
