                <p>Years had passed since Alexia last called Waylon by that old nickname. Back then, neither of them saw the other as an enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia embodied sweetness itself-charming, soft in every word,always glued to his side. Waylon, on the other hand, built walls as high as his ego. Untouchable.Admired and envied in equal measure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silent moment stretched out as Waylon simply watched Alexia, his gaze drifting over every detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attention to her looks had always come naturally for Alexia. She never missed a chance to turn heads,and today, she did just that. The cold seemed to bother everyone but her. Draped in a fitted evening gown,skin bared to the chill, she moved with an effortless grace, her bare shoulders and elegant neckline drawing more than a few lingering stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon remained unmoved. When no response came from him, Alexia&#39;s fingers slipped away, the light in her eyes dimming to a believable sorrow-a vulnerability so convincing it left the onlookers shifting uncomfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to go, she barely made it a step before Waylon&#39;s voice cut in, cool as ever.ome with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia stopped short. The crowd&#39;s breath caught and then spilled out all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Elton let out a weary sigh. It was always the same. Waylon never saw through her tricks,always ready to spoil her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With effortless grace, Alexia turned back, the hint of a smile on her lips. No words were needed as a heavy coat settled across her shoulders, radiating Waylon&#39;s warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, her hands tightened around the fabric,a tiny reaction betraying her calm, and she lifted her gaze to meet his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words weren&#39;t needed. She understood, and with a quiet assurance, slipped into place at his side. Elton shifted away, giving her space to stand close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the club&#39;s upper lounge, the group took their seats. They had the best view, overlooking a crowd gathering for the city&#39;s annual equestrian and shooting competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement buzzed through the room as Alexia glanced toward Waylon. &#34;Wally, did you put your money down? You know everyone&#39;s picking either Black Mamba or Royal Lion. Which one&#39;s yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not once did Waylon meet her eyes, his attention fixed on the arena. His reply was flat. &#34;Since when did you get to call me that? We don&#39;t exactly have that kind of relationship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sweetness in her voice didn&#39;t waver. &#34;Isn&#39;t that what we&#39;re here to figure out? Maybe we&#39;re closer than you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s gaze sharpened as he studied her enthusiastic demeanor with quiet suspicion. &#34;We&#39;re anything but close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia tipped her head, laughter in her eyes. &#34;Give it forty-eight hours. We&#39;ll see how close we get.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly done with her playful needling, Waylon nudged the conversation back to the present. &#34;I haven&#39;t made my pick yet for the finals. Tell me,do you have a tip?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark lit up in Alexia&#39;s eyes as she grinned with a playful edge. &#34;Simple. Put your money on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer made Waylon&#39;s eyebrows flicker upward,if only for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Choose me,Waylon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush swept through the lounge, leaving only the sound of puzzled whispers and curious stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weren&#39;t these two just trading flirtatious remarks? Now she wanted in on the contest herself? Nobody could keep up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon shot her a sharp look. &#34;You&#39;re not listed as a participant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Plenty of time before things get started. Slpping another name onto the roster isn&#39;t exactly a hassle.&#34;Alexia let her gaze land on Elton, a hint of challenge in her smile. &#34;As the club&#39;s biggest shareholder, I&#39;m sure Elton has the final say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lounging comfortably, Elton let out a laugh, more than happy to watch the back-and-forth unfold.&#34;Depends-only if Waylon&#39;s on board.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was not a flicker of doubt in Alexia&#39;s smile.win? Think of it as my gift for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s brow arched slightly, mild curiosity surfacing beneath that usual cool exterior. &#34;So, what&#39;s the price tag for betting on you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every last cent,&#34; she answered, clear and unflinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That boldness pulled the air out of the room. Stunned looks bounced between Elton and Korbin, while Ada&#39;s hand flew to her lips, eyes huge with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Alexia really just thrown that down-right in front  of Waylon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elton just grinned, clearly relishing the chaos. &#34;Pretty sure I&#39;ve never seen anyone so sure of themselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia retorted, &#34;Not just talk-check my track record.I only play for stakes that matter. The rest? Not worth my time. Are you worried the risk is too much for you,Waylon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, nobody spoke. The tension ratcheted higher. Ada sputtered on her drink, shocked beyond words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way-was Alexia really baiting Waylon out in the open like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Korbin glanced nervously between the two, struggling to guess what Waylon would do next. Surely he wouldn&#39;t bite at such a blatant dare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, a slow smile crept onto Waylon&#39;s lips.&#34;Match her bet,&#34; he said, his voice dropping to a command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People scrambled to follow his order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone caught their breath, Waylon leaned forward,voice steady but laced with a hint of menace.&#34;But if you lose, Alexia, the payment is you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit like a jolt, and suddenly, everyone in the  room could sense the shift in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s heart stumbled. &#34;And what exactly does winning me entail?&#34;</p>
