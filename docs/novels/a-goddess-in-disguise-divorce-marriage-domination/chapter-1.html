                <p>Mirs Gibsom. do you have anything to say about youn husband showig up at Mantlee Jenkins&#39; birthday party today and emmouncing that he&#39;s going to divorce you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People are saying Manilee is MM. Gibson&#39;s first love and the real daughter of your parents, while you&#39;re the fale Youve been enjoying her parents&#39; love all this time and morried to the man meant for her. Do you feel bad about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your parents just said you&#39;re not really their daughter and cut off your money. You&#39;ve been out of work for two years, living as a housewife, so how exactly do you plan to support yourself now? Mrs. Gibson, any comments?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The birthday party was crowded, and Alexia Gibson found herself completely trapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporters quickly closed in on her, pushing cameras and microphones into her face as camera flashes burst from every direction, giving her no space to breathe</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia just stood there, frozen. Her mind was still spinning from everything she&#39;d just heard So this Marilee Jenkins was the real daughter of her so -called parents and her husband&#39;s true love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And her? She was Roger Gibson&#39;s wife on paper, but clearly, just a joke to everyone else</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, the Jenkins couple had pulled her out of some run-down neighborhood overseas, saying she was their long-lost daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But had they really not bothered doing a simple DNA test before welcoming her in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did they only discover the mistake now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s body tensed up. Her eyes drifted over to the man standing next to her. However, Roger&#39;s attention was not on her. He was looking at Marilee, as if they were the only ones in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice came out strained as she asked, &#34;Why? You didn&#39;t even tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s face was as cold as stone. &#34;Now you know.That&#39;s all that matters. It&#39;s over, Alexia. You were never good enough for me. Our marriage? Just a transaction. The only woman I&#39;ve ever loved is Marilee.And you know why I never touched you after the wedding? Because you disgust me. You&#39;re like a spoiled dish-completely unappetizing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes swept over her from head to toe, full of scorn. Her simple clothes, those outdated glasses-everything about her clashed with the glossy, high-class world he lived in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before his harsh words even fully sank in, Alexia lifted her glass and threw the champagne right into his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drink hit him with a loud splash, soaking his face and pricey suit. He just stood there, stunned, as the liquid dripped from his hair and down his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>spoiled dish? You told mne you wanted an ordinary housewife. Dad and Mom told me they wanted an obedient daughter,who never outdid anyone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she threw the glass to the floor.The sharp crash instantly silenced the whole room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s face turned red with embarrassment. His jaw tightened.&#34;Have you lost your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the stage, the Jenkins couple yelled at her.&#34;Alexia, this is Marilee&#39;s birthday, not a place for your drama!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People in the crowd rolled their eyes and muttered that she was nuts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of them had a clue what she had given up for the two families all these years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shoving through the crowd, Alexia made a beeline for the exit. Reporters swarmed after her like a flood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoved past them all, blind to the pouring rain,deaf to the murmurs and judgment surrounding her.Right now, all she wanted was to get away-far from the noise, the eyes, and the humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she broke through the crowd and made it outside, a bunch of Marilee&#39;s wild fans shoved her hard,and she slipped, landing on the wet road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee was an A-list star in showbiz. Her birthday party was being livestreamed, and tons of fans had gathered outside. The second they saw Alexia step out, the crowd lost it, shouting like wild animals who had just found something to attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia, you&#39;ve got some nerve attending Marilee&#39;s birthday party. You&#39;ve got no shame!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not even the real daughter. Just go back to whatever dump you came from, or are you too hooked on the Jenkins&#39; money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roger&#39;s going to divorce you, and you still think it&#39;s okay to show your face around Marilee? Who do you think you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go away already!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia lay there on the wet street, frozen for a second,while their nasty words echoed all around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a dry, bitter laugh. Everything was such a joke. A broken marriage, a cold family, and now they&#39;d left her completely humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was the point of pretending for so long? She had kept her head down, put up with everything, and this was what she got in the end?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of helplessness washed over her. She closed her eyes, not even caring anymore as the freezing rain drenched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the noise and chaos, a flattering voice broke through. &#34;Mr. Mason.&#34; The polite greeting was followed by firm, steady footsteps coming closer in the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, a black umbrella appeared above her,silently cutting through the rain and offering her shelter from the storm.</p>
