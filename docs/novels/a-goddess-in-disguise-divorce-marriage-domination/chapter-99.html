                <p>Marilee bit her lower lip before asking, &#34;So that&#39;s it?Everything Alexia did just gets swept under the rug?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn let out a long breath and leaned back into the couch, rubbing her temples as if trying to calm a headache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, Marilee, you&#39;ve got to stop looking at this emotionally and start thinking smart. If you connect with the Brooks family, you&#39;ll have real power behind you. Now, if you&#39;re still set on payback, I can help,but only if you start thinking clearly. Go on this date,and I promise, Alexia won&#39;t get off easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee&#39;s heart didn&#39;t feel as heavy after hearing that.A part of her was starting to consider Evelyn&#39;s offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, her mother wasn&#39;t lying-she had the looks and the brains. She deserved someone better than Roger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe going on the date wouldn&#39;t be so bad, as long as Roger never found out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Roger sat alone at a bar, drowning his mood in alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway into his drink, a waiter placed a martini in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger narrowed his eyes. &#34;This isn&#39;t mine. You&#39;ve got the wrong table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, that one&#39;s from me,&#34; a voice chimed in from nearby before the waiter could reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger turned to see a man strolling over, wearing a bold red shirt, hair slicked back like he was auditioning for a movie, and a flashy Rolex catching the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man stopped by their table and greeted him casually, &#34;You must be Roger Gibson. I&#39;ve heard a lot about you. I&#39;m Vinson Hardy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger gave him a once-over, his eyes briefly showing a flicker of contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nouveau riche.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger wasn&#39;t interested, and he kept his tone frosty &#34;Take your drink and leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Vinson didn&#39;t flinch. He pulled out the chair across from Roger and sat down. &#34;Mr. Gibson, you really do live up to your reputation. But how long can you keep up this arrogant act? Gibson Group hasn&#39;t exactly been shining in the stock market lately. I also heard you&#39;re after the west city project. Honestly,some people just have terrible instincts-doesn&#39;t matter how rich they are; they&#39;ll still waste it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger set his glass down and shot him a deadly glare. &#34;Since when do nobodies like you have opinions on the Gibson family? Walk away while I&#39;m still being polite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vinson just shrugged like it was nothing. &#34;Funny thing. I&#39;m one of the investors here. If someone&#39;s getting kicked out, it won&#39;t be me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s expression turned colder. &#34;Owning part of a bar doesn&#39;t mean you get to be a pest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vinson lit a cigarette, took a slow drag, then casually slid a business card across the table to Roger. &#34;I&#39;m here with a genuine offer. Rather than putting all your energy into flashy tourism ventures, have you thought about pivoting toward something bigger?These days, it&#39;s the tech companies that shape the future. You know that better than anyone. Otherwise,you wouldn&#39;t have started Black Dawn Tech. But let&#39;s be honest, your products haven&#39;t quite hit the mark,and the funding hasn&#39;t exactly been smooth either.So why not team up with us? It could be the push your company needs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger gave the card a quick look, not hiding his skepticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dracnesse International Biotech? A regional manager?&#34; Roger read aloud with a raised brow, then let out a dry laugh. &#34;What kind of no-name operation is this? Never heard of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vinson stubbed out his cigarette. &#34;True, we&#39;re under the radar and not huge yet, but our research team is top-tier-way ahead of what your guys are working with at Black Dawn Tech.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger leaned back, clearly uninterested, and didn&#39;t even try to mask it. &#34;Your team&#39;s resume doesn&#39;t concern me. Black Dawn Tech&#39;s future lies in Al and digital tech-not biotech. We&#39;re not even in the same lane,so what exactly are you trying to prove here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vinson raised an eyebrow and looked straight at him,his tone sharp. &#34;Are you really unaware, or just choosing to ignore it? Black Dawn Tech&#39;s falling stock and market pessimism all stem from one thing -investors have lost confidence in your company.You&#39;ve had no real product release in ages. To the outside world, it&#39;s starting to look like a scam. How long do you think you can survive by sellingjust ideas? Our company has a capable research team,but we lack a strong platform in this country. If we partner up, you can take the naming rights and half the product copyright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s expression changed the moment he heard that. &#34;I&#39;ll have to think it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Vinson didn&#39;t back off. &#34;Take all the time you need, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll come around. The summit&#39;s just around the corner, right? It&#39;s the best time for you to reflect. Sit in the audience, listen to the discussions, and see for yourself if anyone brings up those failing sectors the Gibson family is still trying to hold on to.&#34;</p>
