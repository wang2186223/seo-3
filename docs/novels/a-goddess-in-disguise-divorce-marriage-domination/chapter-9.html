                <p>Alexia let out a bitter laugh.o that&#39;s how it is. No wonder the Jenkins couple always looked at me like l didn&#39;t belong. They brought me into their home, but their real daughter had to live in someone else&#39;s home.Of course they resented me. Why didn&#39;t you tell mne this sooner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre simply shrugged, looking totally unbothered.&#34;Gaia&#39;s orders. She thought you needed to trip up a bit and said it&#39;d help you grow some character.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia narrowed her eyes at him. &#34;Typical. I&#39;m guessing you and Gaia already dug into Roger and Marilee&#39;s affair long ago,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre chuckled. &#34;If you want the evidence, we&#39;ve got plenty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia waved it off without hesitation. &#34;No need.They&#39;re not worth the effort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her bluntness made Andre raise an eyebrow. &#34;NowI&#39;m really curious-what did you ever see in Roger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question gave Alexia pause. She sifted through old memories, but all that surfaced was the image of that stubborn, broken boy from long ago-the only version of him that had ever truly stayed with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But deep down, she knew the truth that Roger was never the point. Growing up as an orphan before the Jenkins family found her, all she ever wanted was a real family. Everything she did-every sacrifice,every choice-was about winning love,about making people proud of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That mindset had followed her into adulthood,especially in relationships. Love, to her, meant lifting the other person up, pouring everything into them,and hoping they&#39;d return even a fraction of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And marriage? Back then, she thought it was the key to finally being loved-something she had to earn,not something she deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But standing in the present, looking back, she couldn&#39;t help but laugh at how wrong she had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre didn&#39;t look surprised. That familiar smirk tugged at his lips, amused and knowing. &#34;I figured.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head. &#34;Figured what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That it was never really about Roger. Most people think they understand love, but they don&#39;t. You didn&#39;t either.&#34; He shot her a playful grin. &#34;Roger just happened to be there. If I&#39;d met you back then, broken, desperate, and just as lost as him, maybe you&#39;d be with me now,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia gave him a sharp look, ready to shut him down,but before she could speak, Andre suddenly turned the wheel and sent the car drifting smoothly through a tight corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, she grabbed the seatbelt and glared at him as the cars around them skidded to a halt in panic.&#34;Pull a stunt like that again in the city and they&#39;ll revoke your license.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre just laughed, unfazed. &#34;So what? Let them. I&#39;ve still got my pro racing license-they can&#39;t touch that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone buzzed in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked down. It was a call from Eleanor Gibson,Roger&#39;s grandmother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of hesitation crossed her face before she finally picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Eleanor... No, I wasn&#39;t avoiding you... I&#39;ll stop by tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre didn&#39;t say a word and quietly listened until the call disconnected, right as the traffic light switched to green.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a sideways glance.,where to now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia let out a slow breath, clearly reluctant. &#34;Golden Lake Estate. Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place belonged to the Gibson family, where Roger&#39;s grandparents lived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre gave a mock salute, tapping two fingers to his temple. &#34;Anything for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia gave him a dry stare but didn&#39;t respond</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short while later, they pulled up outside the estate.As Alexia reached for the door, Andre hesitated, like something had been on his mind for a while. &#34;Actually,there&#39;s another reason I came to Afoross. I&#39;ve got a task I need your help with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s hand paused on the door handle. &#34;What kind of task?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre&#39;s expression turned serious. &#34;A batch of biotech chips was smuggled out of the Garden of Eden recently. The most important one is embedded in a crown-the Adam&#39;s Heart. It&#39;s already in Afoross and is set to be auctioned at the upcoming charity gala held by the Chamber of Commerce. I&#39;m sure you can guess the top bidders at that event. One of them will be the buyer. And we can&#39;t let the chip fall into the wrong hands. We need you to get that crown-ideally,through Waylon Mason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of that name. Alexia frowned and asked. &#34;Why him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre&#39;s usual smirk returned &#34;You&#39;ve really been out of the loop. huh? The Chamber of Commerce is about to elect a new president. And lets just say backroom politics are in full swing. That charity auction is being framed as a public welcome party for Waylon. So, you see where this is going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even people who didn&#39;t follow politics could tell something big was going to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre dropped his voice a notch. &#34;Only Waylon has the clout to shut that auction down without causing a storm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he stepped in, it would settle everything smoothly -no arguments, no messy fallout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia narrowed her eyes. &#34;That still doesn&#39;t explain why you want me involved. You all know I&#39;m not exactly on good terms with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, come on. That was years ago. Who knows?Maybe things have changed. Besides, rumor has it Waylon&#39;s planning to show up at the Equestrian and Shooting Tournament soon. Why don&#39;t you seize the chance to mend fences?&#34; Andre threw her a playful wink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia pushed the door open and slammed it shut behind her.</p>
