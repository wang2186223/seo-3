                <p>A surge of irritation ran through Zayne as the mockery sank in, his fist balling tight at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a swagger and a smug look, Travis made his exit soon after making his point clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Travis had departed, Zayne&#39;s secretary placed a cup of coffee on his desk.you shouldn&#39;t let his comments get under your skin. Northbay is a challenging market. No one knows if he&#39;ll actually manage a win out there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long sip, Zayne asked, &#34;Have you found Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary shook his head. &#34;Not yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zayne refused to give up. &#34;Don&#39;t stop searching. I need to find her, whatever it takes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the next morning, Jenkins Group&#39;s stock dropped just as many had feared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate to change the conversation, Evelyn dialed up her media contacts, feeding them salacious stories about well-known celebrities, hoping the public would shift their focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things didn&#39;t turn out as she hoped, though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The celebrity camps hit back hard. Their fans unleashed a tidal wave of accusations and rumors about Marilee, pushing her PR team to the brink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Marilee sat nursing one drink after another at a bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from her, Dina looked immaculate in a sleek black designer dress, clearly annoyed by the scene. just a little gossip online. Why let it get to you? That&#39;s not like you at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no idea.&#34; Lowering her glass, Marilee let her head sink into her palm, cheeks tinged with pink. &#34;I can lose to anyone out there, but I refuse to lose to Alexia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it just because she was married to Roger?&#34; Dina questioned, a crease between her brows. &#34;Roger chose you in the end. Isn&#39;t that what matters?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer didn&#39;t satisfy Marilee. &#34;Having his heart isn&#39;t enough for me. Alexia&#39;s name is on everyone&#39;s lips, and people can&#39;t stop defending her. Meanwhile, all I get is criticism. The internet is against me, my parents nag, and my brothers keep calling me out. How am I supposed to accept all that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She honestly believed that her fame would be enough to steer the crowd against Alexia. Instead, everything blew up in her face, leaving her in an even worse position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dina thought it over for a moment. &#34;You can&#39;t blame yourself for everything. Nobody expected Alexia to be so clever. At least your fans still stand by you. Give it a little time, and things will go back to normal. If you&#39;re desperate for help, my boyfriend could handle it. I believe you&#39;ve heard of the Black Tiger Gang.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee knew her so-called boyfriend was actually her sugar daddy. She lifted her glass and gave Dina a playful grin. &#34;If you actually manage this, what kind of thank you would you like from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dazzling smile, Dina replied, &#34;You know, he&#39;s been hoping to meet you for ages. Why don&#39;t the three of us share a meal sometime soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Marilee&#39;s expression wavered, Dina reached out and squeezed her hand. &#34;Relax. He&#39;s got a sterling reputation and is well-connected across the industry. I wouldn&#39;t have gotten this far if he hadn&#39;t treated me right. He&#39;s genuinely interested in meeting you, and maybe he&#39;ll want to back your next project. You&#39;ve got a huge following now, so many investors would line up just for a meal with you. Please, say yes, for both our sakes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flattered by the praise, Marilee tapped her glass to Dina&#39;s. &#34;Alright, you&#39;ve convinced me. I&#39;ll doit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Alexia arrived home after a long day, spotted a fridge full of fresh ingredients, and felt a sudden urge to whip up a feast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After slipping on her apron, she started to hum, moving easily from one task to the next in the kitchen. In the middle of her preparations, a soft, deliberate knock interrupted her rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening the door,Alexia found herself face-to-face with a woman exuding grace and sophistication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing just beside the woman, Betsey offered a timid greeting. &#34;You remember me, right? Mom and I came to pick up Ginger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle smile, Alexia patted the top of Betsey&#39;s head. &#34;How could I forget you, Betsey?&#34; She gave the girl&#39;s hair a playful ruffle, then turned to the woman at her side. &#34;You must be Ms. Adams.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena acknowledged her with a nod. &#34;Yes, that&#39;s right. I&#39;ve been meaning to thank you for what you did. 1really appreciate you stepping in for Betsey-coming here to thank you in person felt right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brushing it off with a light wave, Alexia stepped aside. &#34;It was really nothing at all. Please, come inside and make yourselves comfortable. I&#39;ll fetch Ginger. He&#39;s been on the mend; you&#39;ll be glad to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a kind smile, Serena replied, &#34;Thank you so much, and sorry to trouble you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They soon settled on the sofa, making polite conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, the unmistakable scent of something burning drifted in from the kitchen.</p>
