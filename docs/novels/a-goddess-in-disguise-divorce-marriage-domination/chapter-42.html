                <p>Bathed in the gentle light, Waylon&#39;s features took on a golden warmth. &#34;You don&#39;t have to give the necklace back. I want you to wear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia shook her head. &#34;I really can&#39;t keep it-it&#39;s far too extravagant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexia, consider it my way of making amends.&#34; With a small gesture, he lifted his phone and waggled it in front of her. &#34;By the way, unblock my number.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia retorted, &#34;You were the first to block me,seven years ago. I only did it to get back at you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why the necklace is an apology,&#34; Waylon replied, a gentle smile touching his lips as he met her eyes. &#34;I&#39;ll take the blame for everything. The person l was back then... let&#39;s just say, I wouldn&#39;t blame you for being upset. I&#39;m asking for a little forgiveness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rarely did anyone see Waylon&#39;s guarded exterior fall away. The sudden tenderness in his tone left little room for resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking into his earnest smile, Alexia found herself unable to offer a single cutting word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inwardly, she scolded herself for being so easily disarmed by his sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly glimmer entered her gaze. &#34;You know, I&#39;m not nearly as childish as you were back then.&#34; As the necklace&#39;s story drifted through her mind, she happened to glance down at his hand, noticing his fingers were bare, with no ring to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet breath escaped Alexia, though a peculiar uncertainty remained beneath her composure,something she couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll accept your apology gift,&#34; she said at last, &#34;but l owe you a favor in return. If you ever need anything,just ask and I&#39;ll help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon offered an easy nod. &#34;You can count on it.l won&#39;t hesitate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a simple acknowledgment. &#34;Good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day brought Alexia to the entrance of Elite Bar, where she was set to meet Andre.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Bar, known throughout Afoross for its exclusive atmosphere, had always attracted investors from every corner of the city. Years back, the Garden of Eden had poured significant resources into securing a stake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making her way to the reserved booth, Alexia discovered Andre had not yet arrived. She ordered a pair of whiskies and settled in to wait. Not long after,a server approached, placing an unfamiliar bottle in front of her with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes landed on the label, confusion etching her brow. &#34;I don&#39;t remember ordering this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Compliments of a gentleman, over there,&#34; the waiter explained, gesturing towards a direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity led her gaze across the room to a rough-edged man draped in confidence, a woman in striking, over-the-top attire hanging on his arm. The woman, with nails painted a dazzling red, drew a cigarette from a gold case and pressed it between his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in the cigarette, he let smoke drift lazily from his lips. Noticing a pair of eyes on him, he shifted his gaze toward Alexia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia spoke up without hesitation. &#34;Take this bottle back. I&#39;m not interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of unease crossed the waiter&#39;s face. By then, the man had already sauntered over, intent clear in every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every detail in place-hair meticulously styled,shirt hanging loose around his frame, a high-end watch glinting at his wrist-he gave Alexia a lingering look. His tone was casual, but his intent unmistakable. &#34;You free later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reply cut like ice. &#34;Leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, surprise registered on his face, and a hush fell over the table. The waiter, caught between them, stayed rooted to the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension hung until the man broke it with a low chuckle, eyes flickering with intrigue. &#34;Do you know wholam?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia offered no reply, allowing the silence to stretch uncomfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as he seemed ready to push further, another voice broke in. Andre appeared, words sharp.&#34;Darling, isn&#39;t this our date? Who is this guy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men locked eyes, each sizing up the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre didn&#39;t bother to hide his irritation. &#34;Who are you? Why are you in our way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mopping his brow nervously, the waiter interjected,&#34;This is Mr. Vinson Hardy-he owns a stake in Elite Bar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition briefly flickered in Andre&#39;s eyes before he masked it with a calm stare. &#34;Shareholder or not,you don&#39;t get to crash our date. Harassing customers isn&#39;t exactly good manners, is it? Is this the way Tripp Webster runs things around here? Go fetch him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of the owner&#39;s name brought both Vinson and the waiter up short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vinson&#39;s demeanor shifted, his confidence fading just a touch. &#34;Let&#39;s not blow this out of proportion.Just a harmless mix-up. No reason to drag Mr.Webster into it. I meant no offense-only wanted to introduce myself. I&#39;ll cover your bill as an apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A roll of Andre&#39;s eyes said it all. &#34;We can handle our own tab, believe me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm cloud crossed Vinson&#39;s face. With a lingering, disappointed look at Alexia-who still refused to meet his eyes-he turned away and stalked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre sat down with a dramatic flourish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia wasted no time, her eyes sharp. &#34;Vinson Hardy -does that name mean anything to you?&#34;</p>
