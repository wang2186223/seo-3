                <p>Waylon lowered his eyes. &#34;I left the country because of my mother. Back then, her health was failing-her mind, too. She needed care, far from here. And,honestly,my family&#39;s chaos didn&#39;t help. According to their plan, I was never meant to come back at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in his tone sent a ripple through Alexia.She hesitated before asking, &#34;Now that you&#39;re here again,your mom...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That revelation left Alexia wordless, the air between them heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylonbusied himself with the bandages, wrapping her wounds with practiced hands. &#34;When her illness took hold, she became anxious and possessive. She cut me off from everyone I knew. But I can&#39;t hold it against her-she was sick. I remember who she used to be. She was extraordinary, before all that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the last knot was tied, he met her eyes, earnest and unguarded. &#34;I owe you an apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle ache stirred in Alexia&#39;s chest, as if an old at rhost wound was being touched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. &#34;You don&#39;t need to be sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she finally forgave him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d always known what Waylon&#39;s family had been through. His mother,Jordyn Mason,was Cowan&#39;s only daughter, and three decades ago, she had been the brightest star in the upper circles. Graceful,generous,and remarkably gifted, she drew admirers wherever she went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her allure, Jordyn never married. Waylon was born with no father in sight-a fact that drew its share of whispers. But as the years passed, the gossip faded into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one in the city could rival Waylon. He had grown into the Mason family&#39;s living legacy, eclipsing every shadow that came before him. Yet behind all that strength stood Jordyn, whose careful guidance shaped his early years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car glided smoothly to a stop at Orchid Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, Alexia glanced out the window. &#34;Why are we at your place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon answered matter-of-factly, &#34;Santino will look you over, just to be sure. You&#39;ll stay here tonight-it&#39;s easier that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Butlreally am fine. These wounds don&#39;t even count,&#34;she replied, but then caught the uhyielding look in Waylon&#39;s eyes-one that made it clear the decision was not up for dlebate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. One check-up. You win.&#34; With a sigh, Alexia gave in, the fight going out of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon seemed pleased with her answer, his face relaxing. &#34;Any cravings for dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia wasted no time rattling off a list-one fiery,rich dish after another, each more decadent than the last.The longer she went on, the deeper Waylon&#39;s frown dug in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just got hurt. None of that for now. You need something light.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia slumped in disappointment. &#34;So what was the point in asking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly grin played on Waylon&#39;s lips. &#34;I just wanted to know what to serve you next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer made her pause, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they left the car and stepped inside, they saw Santino waiting for them. The moment he spotted Alexia, his face lit up.&#34;Alexia! It&#39;s been forever!&#34; He opened his arms wide for a welcoming hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Santino could get any closer. Waylon slipped in front of him. voice laced with mock disapproval &#34;Tone it down. There&#39;s no need to make a scene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharpness in his words made Santino falter, nearly tripping over his own feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With wounded dignity, Santino shot Waylon a reproachful look. &#34;Not a shred of appreciation!basically watched you grow up! So rude!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amused by their squabbling, Alexia grinned and reached out her hands. &#34;It&#39;s been ages, Santino.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Santino had once been both Jordyn&#39;s trusted physician and the ever-patient school doctor. Back in those days, Alexia had a reputation for stubbornness and a knack for trouble, earning her more visits to the infirmary than anyone else. She was impossible to forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hugged each other as Santino took a moment to study her. Though a hint of pallor lingered on her cheeks, her energy was unmistakable-far better than the last time when she was sick and heartbroken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a knowing look, Santino teased, &#34;I can see it in your eyes-you&#39;ve been in another scrap. When will you stop getting into trouble, even now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia folded her arms across her chest. &#34;It&#39;s not my  requests now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He confirmed with a small nod. &#34;Only if it&#39;s classical.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of nostalgia hit her, and she smiled. &#34;I never realized you could be this easygoing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon shook his head. &#34;This isn&#39;t just a whim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,what&#39;s the reason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze softened. &#34;I want to make you happy.&#34;</p>
