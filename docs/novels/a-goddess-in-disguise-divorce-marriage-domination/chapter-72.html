            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Alexia offered a slight smile. &#34;I took up economics as my minor during college.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena nodded, gripping her cup a little tighter. &#34;I don&#39;t have a choice-I have to bet everything on this.Cosmo Blotech is under attack, and there&#39;s no one to fall back on. That summit is the only hope we have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia spoke plainly, without softening the blow. &#34;If Cosmo Biotech no longer belongs to the Adams family,can you really accept that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena&#39;s shoulders tensed slightly as she slowly put down her knife and fork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Betsey, who had been eating quietly, noticed the sudden tension and glanced at her mother in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena gave a low, dry chuckle after a long silence. &#34;That was brutally honest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s just how this world runs-winner takes everything. Capital doesn&#39;t hand out mercy. If you&#39;re not ready to risk being gutted, then you&#39;re not ready to play. Otherwise, you&#39;ll end up like everyone else-served on a platter, picked clean.&#34; Alexia&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena&#39;s voice was steady but heavy with meaning. &#34;Cosmo Biotech was my grandfather&#39;s creation. It&#39;s the heart of the Adams family. And as his chosen successor, I won&#39;t let it fall into someone else&#39;s hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia just looked at her for a long moment and said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had picked up fragments of Serena&#39;s story through Ada here andthere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena hadn&#39;t exactly drawn a winning hand at birth. As the overlooked third child of the Adams family, she had no support until Cosmo Biotech was on its last legs. Then she stepped up, tossed out her useless brothers, and took the reins herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she hadn&#39;t stepped up back then, Cosmo Biotech would&#39;ve been history five years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her personal life wasn&#39;t much better-rushed into a marriage, divorced just as fast, and now raising a child on her own while carrying the company&#39;s burden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia, deep down, felt an unexpected flicker of empathy. As a woman, she understood that struggle all too Well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dinner wrapped up, and Serena left with Betsey it tow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at her desk, Alexia logged in and shot a message to Moon. &#34;You there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reply came quickly. &#34;Talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One icy word-typical Moon. She didn&#39;t waste time and forwarded the latest stock chart for Cosmo Biotech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Foreign vultures are already circling the company like it&#39;s a buffet. And you plan to sit and watch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moon replied, &#34;Not my concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you still alive with a heart that cold?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You called it a buffet. That means it&#39;s meant to be eaten.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s gaze hardened as the meaning hit her. The message couldn&#39;t be clearer.Powerful players in Afoross were all watching Cosmo Biotech struggle, like spectators waiting for the kill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real danger wasn&#39;t foreign forces, it was the insiders sharpening their knives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone behind the scenes was pulling all the right strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia typed back without hesitation. &#34;What if I make a move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His response was immediate. &#34;You don&#39;t even have a seat at this table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh escaped her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was it. He didn&#39;t just think she couldn&#39;t help-he was flat-out saying she didn&#39;t belong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really think I&#39;m not capable?&#34; she muttered to herself, the corners of her lips curling in a half-smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, that short exchange told her everything she needed to know. If she jumped in now under the name Luna, Moon would push back instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d end up in another head-to-head, and that would only waste time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,there were better ways to play this game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Waylon closed the financial forum tab and initiated a cross-border video call. A wel-dressed man appeared on screen, skimming a document in a sharp silver-gray suft. &#34;Waylon, I heard you just sank billions into a new energy startup. First time using Ravenwood Financial Group to fund a domestic project. That&#39;s unexpected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s voice was as even as ever. &#34;It&#39;s a solid opportunity. I believe in the sector. Nothing surprising about thai.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. &#34;Uh-huh. But here&#39;s the kicker-Cowant has been busy playing matchmaker, right? Word is, he lined up a few polished heiresses for you. And one of them? Her family runs deep in energy. So, you respond by investing a fortune into her biggest competitor? Even for you, that&#39;s ice cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon didn&#39;t blink. &#34;I you&#39;re that concerned about her feelings, Ryan, why don&#39;t you marry her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change. &#34;Hard pass. Been there, done that. Once was enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon let out a quiet chuckle. &#34;You&#39;re flying back next month for the summit. After that, you&#39;ll be stationed in Afoross permanently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan Walker&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re opening a branch in Afoross. You&#39;Il oversee operations and keep tabs on Cowan&#39;s people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were still unfinished battles with the Mason family, and he hadn&#39;t forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan didn&#39;t respond immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon saw the hesitation and asked, &#34;What? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re still not over stepping back into the same country as your ex? If others knew that, they wouldn&#39;t need to try and find your Achilles&#39; heel. Flash her picture and you roll over like a puppy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s jaw tensed. &#34;You&#39;ve never been married. You wouldn&#39;t get it. You&#39;re a damn psychopath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon gave a light nod, completely unfazed. &#34;Appreciate the flattery. Now stop whining and get back to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan sighed.How was that even a compliment?</p>
