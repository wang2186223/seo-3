                <p>When Roger saw Marilee&#39;s pale face and how quiet she was, he asked in disbelief, &#34;Marilee, is that really you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee quickly shook her head, her eyes welling up with tears. &#34;No, that&#39;s not me! Alexia, how can you say that voice is mine? Watch what you say-l can sue you for slander!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia arched an eyebrow and smiled coolly. &#34;The call came from a number tied to your real name. Still in denial? We can always let the court handle it. I&#39;ve got witnesses and experts ready to confirm the voice.But maybe it won&#39;t even get that far. Once this audio goes public, I&#39;m sure the entertainment world would love to step in and teach you a lesson. Isn&#39;t that so,superstar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee&#39;s face turned red. &#34;You&#39;re disgusting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia narrowed her eyes and sneered, &#34;Me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgusting? You weren&#39;t saying that when it was you playing dirty. You just can&#39;t handle it now that the tables have turned. I won&#39;t stop until you&#39;ve lost everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee froze at the cold smirk on Alexia&#39;s face. A chill ran down her spine, and without thinking,she moved behind Roger for cover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>mf you try to destroy my name, you&#39;ll be fighting the Jenkins family and Roger too! My parents raised you,Alexia. And this is how you repay them? You&#39;re cruel and ungrateful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia&#39;s gaze turned icy. &#34;Still playing the victim? Not even a hint of guilt. There&#39;s no point in dragging this conversation out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could walk away, Eleanor reached for her hand. &#34;Alexia, I understand you&#39;ve been hurt. I truly do. But can we please handle this quietly? Let&#39;s not drag the Gibson family into this...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor cared deeply about how the Gibson name was seen. Roger and Marilee&#39;s affair wasn&#39;t exactly a secret in their social circle, or even among fans, but so far, it hadn&#39;t gone public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Allen had always wanted Roger to move into politics. Things hadn&#39;t gone.as planned, but if his reputation was completely ruined now, he&#39;d never get another shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And since Marilee was still tied to Roger, any hit on her would end up damaging him too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding the risk, Eleanor lowered her voice and pleaded, &#34;Please, let&#39;s settle this in private.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands shook slightly as she held Alexia&#39;s,something Eleanor had rarely ever done, showing how desperate she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That moment stirred something deep inside Alexia.Her heart tightened with mixed emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up, the rest of the Jenkins family had kept their distance, but Eleanor had always shown her warmth. To Alexia, she was more of a grandmother than anyone else ever had been. It was because of Eleanor that she tried to get close to Roger back then -just so they could be friends and share happy moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, I&#39;ve told you everything. If I hadn&#39;t been lucky, I wouldn&#39;t even be standing here today. I gave everything to this family after I married in. I did my part-whether it was running the house or looking after Gloria when she broke her leg. I was there, day and night, for two years. But what did I get back? A husband who cheated, a mother-in-law who never stopped criticizing me, and years of being treated like | didn&#39;t matter.&#34; While speaking, Alexia held out her hand,showing the rough calluses on her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After the divorce, I couldn&#39;t even look at my hands without wondering what kind of spell I&#39;d been under.Why was I bending over backward for people just to be seen as a good wife? A good daughter-in-law?And then it hit me-what&#39;s the difference between that and being a maid? Except maids actually get paid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words cut through the air like a blade. No one could say a word. They were stunned into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria, however, flushed red with shame and quickly lashed out. &#34;Well, you only have yourself to blame for not getting pregnant! Two years have passed, and still no child. The Gibson family won&#39;t keep a woman who can&#39;t have kids. If you can&#39;t give Roger an heir,it&#39;s a disgrace to him! This marriage needs to end!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her harsh words made Roger, who&#39;d stayed quiet all this time, go stiff. &#34;Mom, this has nothing to do with Alexia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen suddenly turned to Roger, eyes wide. &#34;Are you impotent or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question made both Roger and Marilee freeze in place. Marilee knew better than anyone about Roger&#39;s capabilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. In two years of marriage, I never touched her.&#34;Roger clenched his teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he was being honest, a part of him regretted it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor and the others stared at him in disbelief. But it was Gloria who reacted the most-she looked as if she&#39;d just been slapped. It didn&#39;t make any sense to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the start, she&#39;d disapproved of Alexia. The girl was just too pretty-far too noticeable. Even before marriage, Alexia had attracted the attention of countless men. There had always been buzz around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Gloria&#39;s eyes, someone like that spelled trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And sure, after marriage, Alexia toned herself down.She dressed modestly and acted respectfully,but Gloria never bought into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she kept pushing Alexia down with insults and cold words, thinking it was the only way to keep her in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, hearing that Roger had never even touched her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This marriage had never been real to begin with, so Alexia saw no point in pretending anymore. Roger was a fool-he had the perfect opportunity handed to him and still managed to throw it away.</p>
