                <p>Alexia stepped into the flower shop and browsed through the fresh blooms. She picked out some yellow roses and a few daisies. With the shop assistant&#39;s help, she arranged themn into a lovely new bouquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they tied the ribbon, the assistant smiled and asked, &#34;Miss, is this for someone special or just a treat for yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia cradled the bouquet in her arms, her smile gentle. &#34;A friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman beamed. &#34;Well then, whoever that friend is, man or woman,they&#39;re very lucky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the bouquet in hand, Alexia hurried back toward the building. As she ran under the golden sun, hair bouncing and flowers pressed to her chest, she turned more than a few heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strangers paused in their tracks just to watch her. In that moment, she looked like something out of a movie-effortless, glowing,real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she reached the entrance, she waved at Waylon, completely unaware of the shock on the faces around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathless from the run, her cheeks flushed a soft pink, and her eyes sparkled as she stopped in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a radiant smile, she held out the bouquet. &#34;This is for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of silence passed over the small crowd nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she really handing flowers to Waylon just like that? Was this some kind of public confession?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Waylon stared at the bouquet,visibly surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the flowers, his fingers brushing against the petals.&#34;Yellow roses? What do they mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re for apologies,&#34; Alexia said, her voice soft but clear. &#34;They stand for sincerity and friendship.But really, before anvthing else, I just wanted to thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon glanced up, intrigued. &#34;Thank me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, her gaze fixed on him with quiet warmth. &#34;Thank you for coming back into my life. I don&#39;t know what fate has planned for us, but l&#39;m really grateful we crossed paths again. Meeting you again is wonderful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of him, she was able to close a painful</p>
