                <p>During the finals, Roger crossed paths with the young woman again, and that time, he returned the sketchbook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at him curiously. &#34;Why are you giving it back? Didn&#39;t you like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked away, eyes growing colder. &#34;Not even a little.Tell her to stop drawing me. I never want her attention again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory surfaced as Roger stared at the painting now displayed on stage. &#34;Sirius is remarkable. No matter what people say, whether they mock or envy her,she&#39;s unmatched.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee felt a quiet jab in her chest. She spoke lightly,but her jealousy slipped through. &#34;Roger, do you like her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he speak with such admiration for someone he didn&#39;t even know personally?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger averted his eyes. &#34;I just admire her, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he finished, the auctioneer&#39;s voice echoed through the hall. &#34;Starting bid for this painting-twenty million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs rippled through the hall as the crowd exchanged looks, clearly impressed by the skyrocketing value of Sirius&#39; work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that a modern painting could fetch such a staggering price spoke volumes about its global influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger didn&#39;t pause for even a second. He raised his paddle confidently.&#34;Forty million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee froze on the spot. When she saw the unshakable resolve in Roger&#39;s eyes, frustration welled up inside her, and she bit her lip hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia,too, was caught off guard. She couldn&#39;t quite make sense of Roger&#39;s sudden urge to get involved.Noticing that most of the crowd had gone quiet, and few dared to challenge Roger&#39;s bid, she lifted her paddle. &#34;Sixty million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sudden bid made Waylon turn to look at her,while murmurs and gasps rippled through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, Alexia&#39;s bidding too? And against Roger?Wasn&#39;t he her ex-husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She must be doing it out of spite. Everyone knows Roger is bidding for Marilee. My husband said their affair has been an open secret for two years-Roger never even tried to hide it. Alexia was the only one who didn&#39;t know. It&#39;s no surprise she wants payback.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What affair? Marilee&#39;s the rightful heiress of the Jenkins family. If there hadn&#39;t been that mix-up years ago, she&#39;d be the one married to Roger, not Alexia.Honestly, Alexia was never meant to win. She&#39;s just some penniless stand-in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Roger had loved Marilee so much, he wouldn&#39;t have married another woman to begin with!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murmurs around the hall reached Roger, and his face clouded over with growing irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Marilee&#39;s eyes welled up, portraying the image of a heartbroken victim all too convincingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger held her hand tightly and promised in a low,resolute voice, &#34;Marilee, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll marry you and give you a wedding so grand the world won&#39;t dare question you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee gave a small nod but still looked concerned.&#34;I believe you, Roger, but do you really think Alexia is doing this just to spite us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger sneered, shooting Alexia a contemptuous glance. &#34;She really thinks she can challenge me just because she&#39;s hanging onto Waylon now?&#34; His face steeled, and without hesitation, he raised his paddle again. &#34;One hundred million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He refused to let Alexia walk away with a victory, no matter what it took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frosty smile tugged at Alexia&#39;s lips. She had no intention of letting Roger take that painting home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One hundred twenty million,&#34; she said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s gaze sharpened. It was clear-Alexia wasn&#39;t backing down. She was in this fight to the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An invisible tension filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching from nearby, Waylon&#39;s eyes glinted with amusement. &#34;Didn&#39;t expect you to be this generous.Looks like you&#39;ve taken a liking to Sirius after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia stiffened, momentarily speechless. &#34;Yes, I like it,&#34; she said after a while. &#34;That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to win it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon raised an eyebrow with a faint smirk. &#34;Is that so? Funny-because | like it too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia was briefly taken aback by his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could say anything, Waylon raised his paddle. &#34;Five hundred million,&#34; he said, as if it were nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd, already tense, was now completely stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is going on? Why is Waylon suddenly bidding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is turning into some bizarre love triangle. I need a second look just to follow it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ls that painting even worth this much? This is insane!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s outrageous bid sent shockwaves through the entire hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger&#39;s confidence faltered for a split second after hearing that number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the tension, Marilee gently took his hand and said, &#34;Roger, maybe we should just step back. If Waylon wants it, let him have it. It&#39;s only a painting-no need to throw away money over this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roger didn&#39;t say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, it seemed like he might back down,just like he had during the fight for the Adam&#39;s Heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, slowly and firmly, he slipped his hand out of Marilee&#39;s grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he did, Marilee felt her heart snk.</p>
