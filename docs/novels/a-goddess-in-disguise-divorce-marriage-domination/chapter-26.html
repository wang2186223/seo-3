                <p>It had been ages since Alexia last slipped into an evening gown. The feeling was strange, as if she had crossed over into a world where she didn&#39;t quite belong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon&#39;s eyes flickered with something he quickly concealed. With quiet sincerity, he told her, &#34;You are absolutely breathtaking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words caught Alexia off guard. For someone rarely flustered, she found herself fighting a faint blush. The room, once buzzing, fell into perfect silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon gestured to his assistant, who appeared holding a velvet box. Inside, a sapphire necklace gleamed beneath the lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linked gems formed a sparkling river, while tiny glass :vehicles lined the entrance. Guests glided past,dressed in glamour, the atmosphere pulsing with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee emerged from a polished car, gratitude in her smile as she turned to her companion. &#34;Thank you so much for helping me tonight, Pierson. Without you,l wouldn&#39;t have even set foot at this event.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pierson Simpson, a friend of hers, smiled warmly.&#34;You don&#39;t have to thank me, Marilee. I&#39;m always here when you need me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee&#39;s lips curved into a sweet smile, a flicker of pride hidden in her eyes. &#34;It&#39;s my first time at an event like this. I&#39;ll be relying on you all evening!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pierson offered a reassuring nod. &#34;It&#39;s nothing.heard a bit about what&#39;s been happening in your family. Alexia is out of the picture now, isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;That&#39;s right. She isn&#39;t my parents&#39; real daughter. She had years of comfort and luxury, which should have been enough for her. If she stayed, where would that leave me? Nobody ever stopped to think about how I felt. It&#39;s just not right.Still, why are you asking about her all of a sudden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brows knitted together, Pierson replied, &#34;Something jogged my memory about her having ties to someone important at tonight&#39;s gathering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That caught Marilee off guard. &#34;You&#39;re talking about Waylon? How could Alexia have anything to do with him? Wasn&#39;t he overseas for years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pierson explained, &#34;My brother let it slip once.Apparently, before Waylon left the country, Alexia&#39;s name kept popping up in those exclusive circles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp laugh escaped Marilee. &#34;Alexia? If she really had any pull in those circles...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surely, if that were the case, she never would have snatched Roger away from Alexia with such ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, if she were so capable, society would have known her name ages ago. Alexia only manages to draw attention from men like Andre. She probably imagines she&#39;s irreplaceable, but in truth, everyone just sees her as a toy. She&#39;s chasing an impossible dream,thinking she could ever catch Waylon&#39;s eye!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee&#39;s tirade was cut short as a ripple of excitement passed through the crowd outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The arrival of four sleek Bentleys commanded attention, followed by eight men in black stepping out to form a perfect corridor. The assistant slid from the front seat, circled around to the back, and bowed deeply before announcing, &#34;Mr. Mason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glimpse of tailored suit pants appeared first, and as the door opened wider, a strikingly handsome face emerged into the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon stepped out first, immediately stealing the spotlight. Every eye in the plaza seemed drawn to him, as if the world itself tilted in his direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People around him naturally formed a circle of admiration, always careful to keep their distance yet unwilling to drift too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marilee found herself unable to look away, caught up in the same magnetic pull as the rest of the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unexpected gesture followed-Waylon reached back into the car, his movements polished and inviting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman&#39;s hand slipped into his, feather-light and graceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire crowd seemed to pause, breathless with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next moment, Alexia emerged, draped in a black gown that shimmered under the lights. Shock rippled through the onlookers as they recognized her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, is Waylon actually arriving with a female companion tonight? The woman with him is absolutely gorgeous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could she be an actress? But none of the invited guests were celebrities. Still, look at her! She and Waylon look incredible together!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t decide who I envy more right now, and that&#39;s the worst part!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around her, admiration filled the air, and Marilee felt her color drain. Her hands clenched tightly,nails pressing into her palms as disbelief and bitterness mingled in her chest. Seeing Alexia on Waylon&#39;s arm,bathed in the spotlight, felt like a dagger straight to her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no mistake-the woman beside Waylon was Alexia.</p>
