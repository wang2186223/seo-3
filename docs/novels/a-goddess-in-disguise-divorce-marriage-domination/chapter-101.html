                <p>Alexia was momentarily taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had ever said something like that to her before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For most of her life, cooking had been a basic skill-nothing more than a way to survive. She never really tried to make it special. It was only later, when she moved away for high school and lived alone in a small rented apartment, that she began to put more effort into it. With no one around, it became a quiet way to pass time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after marriage, she kept cooking regularly. Part of it was routine, but mostly, it was because Gloria had a leg injury and needed someone to handle things in the kitchen. Gloria would often make comments like, &#34;It&#39;s a simple joy to enjoy a meal cooked by my daughter-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia still remembered one particular conversation with Gloria that left a bitter taste in her mouth. She had suggested hiring a maid, but Gloria had shut her down, saying, &#34;You&#39;ve married my son. That makes you one of us. You&#39;re expected to contribute to this family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexia had been baffled. &#34;I married your son, not sold myself to your family. It&#39;s not like maids are that expensive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gloria had let out a cold laugh before snapping,&#34;That&#39;s easy for you to say. If it weren&#39;t forthe Gibson family, your family would&#39;ve gone under long ago. Your family came to us, begging Roger to marry you. Don&#39;t forget, your mother had you sign the prenup without even blinking. She knew what she owed. So don&#39;t act so high and mighty. You&#39;re here to repay their debt. Understand? Now go and cook.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, thinking back to those words, Alexia could still feel the sting. They had been sharp,humiliating,and impossible to forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what made her feel even more ashamed now was how hard she had tried-how much of herself she poured into that family, tiying to win over Gloria and protect the Jenkins family&#39;s reputation in the eyes of the Gibsons. She had been so eager to please, and for what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you zoning out for?&#34; Waylon&#39;s voice gently tugged her back to the present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Alexia blinked and forced a faint smile. &#34;I was just thinking... no one&#39;s ever complimented my cooking before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naylon let out a snort. &#34;That&#39;s probably because hey don&#39;t know good food when they taste it. But didn&#39;t I praise it before?&#34; He paused, pouting slightly.I clearly remember complimenting it once. You just orgot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes twinkled with amusement as she looked at him, catchinghis mock-offended expression. Even annoyed, he somehow still managed to be charming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked out of the elevator side by side. The building stood in the heart of the city&#39;s busiest district, surrounded by designer boutiques and elegant restaurants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made a dinner reservation,&#34; Alexia said. &#34;Since we missed lunch, this one&#39;s on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wayion gave a soft sigh. &#34;Alexia, do you really enjoy treating people to meals this much? Honestly, if we&#39;re being fair, it was my fault for making you wait all that time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could say more, Alexia shot him a cheeky glare. &#34;I&#39;m glad you realize that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waylon froze, clearly caught off guard by her quick comeback. Though she was offering to treat him,it was obvious she wasn&#39;t exactly thrilled about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they stepped out of the elevator together, heads started turning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reason was simple-until now, no woman had ever exited the building alongside Waylon. Alexia was the first, and her appearance instantly stirred curiosity throughout the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa, who&#39;s that stunning woman with Mr. Mason?She seems really close to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She looks familiar. I think l&#39;ve seen her on a livestream before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, is that Alexia? The one who clapped back at Marilee&#39;s fans-the so-called fake daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? That&#39;s her? She&#39;s even more gorgeous in real life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How on earth did she end up with Mr. Mason? She must have something special...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Alexia could feel the heat of all those curious glances. But oddly enough, when she was with Waylon, the rumors and stares didn&#39;t bother her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as they were about to exit, Alexia suddenly came to a stop and turned to him. &#34;Wait here for me.I just need to take care of something real quick. I&#39;ll be right back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Waylon could even respond, she was already darting off, disappearing into the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the building entrance, people flowed in and out.Some employees, upon seeing Waylon, quickly changed course to avoid him altogether. Others, a little braver, gave nervous bows before hurrying away. Everyone was curious why Waylon was waiting at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was he waiting for? It couldn&#39;t be Simon,because he wouldn&#39;t dare to make Waylon wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been almost twenty mninutes. Has anyone ever seen Mr. Mason wait this long for anyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is wild. It&#39;s always people waiting for him. Not the other way around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right? In the business world, who would even dare let Mr.Mason wait?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But here he is, waiting at the entrance like a regular person. This is huge!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So who is it? Who&#39;s important enough for Mr. Mason to stand here like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd kept whispering among themselves, while Wavion stood still, with one hand casually in his pocket. He checked his watch, his eyes narrowing slightly as he wondered what was taking Alexia so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this be her revenge? Was she trying to get even by making him wait four hours in return?</p>
