                <p>All eyes instantly snapped to Lailah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head spun in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way! Did our team leader actually do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean, she&#39;s always been tight with Trace, but this? Sharing a bed? That&#39;s next level.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh, that&#39;s seriously gross.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs rippled through the room as stares shifted uneasily from one dancer to another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The substitute members&#39; eyes lit up with hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If two full members got kicked out, their own chances of moving up would be much better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah jolted out of her shock and charged at Arabella in a frenzy. &#34;It&#39;s all lies! You conniving bitch-how dare you try to ruin me like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella met her attack with a swift kick. &#34;The clip can be verified. Want to test if it&#39;s fake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if it&#39;s real, he was clearly lying!&#34; Lailah</p>
                
                
                
                <p>snapped, her voice rising. &#34;You must&#39;ve planned this with him to frame me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick&#39;s gaze darkened. So this was the evidence Arabella had hinted at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lailah&#39;s our lead dancer, and this kind of accusation is beyond outrageous,&#34; Patrick said coldly. &#34;Forget throwing them out. Call the police.Let them deal with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the guards didn&#39;t hesitate, and he quickly pulled out his phone to call the police.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah let out a quiet breath of relief and glanced at Arabella with a smug look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Arabella just gave a calm, amused smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick&#39;s frown deepened. &#34;What&#39;s so funny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I came here without evidence?&#34;Arabella chuckled and pulled up another video on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flirtatious female voice played from the phone.&#34;Do you like it, Trace? I wore this just for you...your little sweetheart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trace&#39;s voice was full of delight. &#34;No wonder they say dancers are the best-you do know how to make a man happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the video played, several dancers turned their eyes away in discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was way too explicit. No one imagined Lailah could be so shameless behind closed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People avoided looking at her, their gazes filled with thinly veiled disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah&#39;s confident look disappeared instantly. She stared at the screen in shock, as if the floor had just dropped out from under her. The room went deathly quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a shriek, Lailah lunged again.&#34;Turn that off!You evil witch!&#34; she screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella didn&#39;t even flinch-she kicked her off just as coldly as before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick&#39;s face grew stormy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Lailah had done it that dirty with Trace! She hadn&#39;t caught an STD, had she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury overtook him as he roared, &#34;You&#39;re the troupe&#39;s leader, and this is how you behave?You&#39;ve humiliated us all. You&#39;re fired-effective immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I...&#34; Lailah sobbed, struggling to explain, but the words wouldn&#39;t come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick, furious, had already turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t leave yet, Mr. Stone. The show&#39;s not over,&#34;Arabella said calmly. &#34;I reported Lailah before,but it was covered up. Makes you wonder who&#39;s backing her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People started connecting the dots, staring at Patrick in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone had thought he was upright and fair.Could he really be involved with Lailah too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick turned around, looking serious. &#34;I didn&#39;t know about that. I&#39;ll make sure to investigate it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too late. I already found the truth,&#34; Arabella replied as she waved her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick froze and quickly said, &#34;Let&#39;s talk in private.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a slight nod and followed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the office, Patrick looked uneasy. &#34;What kind of proof do you have?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everything that had just happened, he couldn&#39;t take chances, even if he didn&#39;t want to admit the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If all goes as expected, this should be enough to get you removed from your position,&#34; Arabella said casually, her sharp eyes full of confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick clenched his jaw. &#34;If you want Daisy to stay, fine-she can even be the new team leader.Just drop this now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella smiled faintly. &#34;Nope. That&#39;s not good enough.I want you out of that position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick&#39;s voice rose. &#34;Even if you reveal my relationship with Lailah, we&#39;re just dating. Worst case, I&#39;ll get a slap on the wrist. Nothing serious!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella raised a brow. &#34;Oh, I see. So you&#39;re dating her? I assumed you were family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick blinked. &#34;Wait... you have no proof, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He relaxed for a moment until Arabella added coldly, &#34;You&#39;re right, I didn&#39;t have any proof earlier. But now I do. Bribing others goes against the association&#39;s code of ethics.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the studio, the guards had already escorted Lailah out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The substitute members looked thrilled,especially Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Karlie with a smirk. &#34;No wonder you&#39;re still stuck here. You&#39;re too soft.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still, Daisy didn&#39;t do anything wrong,&#34; Karlie said,standing her ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so naive,&#34; Sarah scoffed, rolling her eyes.She kept glancing toward the office door,waiting for Patrick to walk out. But when it finally opened,only Arabella stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Mr. Stone?&#34; Sarah asked, looking surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella answered calmly, &#34;He&#39;s been dismissed by the association. They also asked me to inform you that Daisy stays. And now that Lailah&#39;s out, a substitute will move up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone stood frozen in shock for a second,then someone asked, &#34;Did they say who gets the spot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a short nod. &#34;Yes, they did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah&#39;s heart raced. Was it finally her turn?</p>
