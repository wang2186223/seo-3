                <p>The driver sneered, his voice cutting through the darkness, &#34;Stop struggling. We&#39;re deep in the wilderness now. No one&#39;s coming to save you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands moved with practiced efficiency as he bound Arabella with rope, then hoisted her toward the riverbank. Rain hammered down around them, turning the rushing water into a roaring torrent that disappeared into the black void below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This ends here,&#34; the driver declared, preparing to hurl Arabella toward the churning river.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she never left his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dagger had found its mark in his abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He doubled over, pain shooting through his body as rage blazed in his eyes. Arabella sliced through her bindings with swift, precise movements and broke free from his weakening grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver lunged forward, desperate to reclaim his prize, but his body refused to obey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t waste your energy. That&#39;s a specialized paralysis technique. You&#39;ll stay frozen until I decide otherwise.&#34; Arabella&#39;s voice carried the chill of winter frost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver&#39;s eyes widened as understanding dawned. &#34;You... you were pretending the whole time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How else could I uncover your true motives?Someone wants me dead, right?&#34; Arabella&#39;s lips curved into a cold smile. &#34;Let me take a wild guess about your employer. The Hydes? No,too obvious. The Lamberts? They lack the spine. It has to be the Tuckers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terror flickered across the driver&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His employer had described a nineteen-year-old girl. Nobody had mentioned she was anything more than an ordinary target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talk. How much did the Tuckers offer you?&#34;Arabella pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well...&#34; the driver stammered. In the next heartbeat, he clenched his fists, channeling his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>remaining strength, and shattered the paralysis.His hand shot toward Arabella like a striking snake. &#34;Enough to make this worthwhile!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His movements blurred through the air,almost too fast to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s eyes sharpened as she twisted away,and the two combatants clashed in the driving rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re from the assassin rankings, aren&#39;t you?&#34;Arabella observed, her voice steady despite the chaos around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clever girl!&#34; The man&#39;s surprise was genuine.&#34;So you know about the rankings. At least this won&#39;t be a complete waste of my time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assassin moved with devastating speed,each strike generating gusts of wind. One solid hit would prove fatal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella possessed remarkable skill, but her endurance couldn&#39;t match the assassin&#39;s relentless assault, and she found herself gradually retreating. Without warning,the assassin produced a dagger, its blade gleaming wickedly in the darkness. &#34;I planned to drown you,but since you insist on being difficult,I&#39;ll</p>
                
                
                
                <p>end this now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thrust the weapon toward Arabella&#39;s left shoulder.She reacted instinctively, dodging the obvious attack, but the assassin&#39;s eyes gleamed with satisfaction as his true target-a second dagger already positioned-pierced her right shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Professional killers never carried just one weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood flowed from Arabella&#39;s wounded shoulder. She bit back a cry of pain. The assassin&#39;s grin widened. &#34;I warned you that you couldn&#39;t win. You might as well beg for your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that what you think?&#34; Arabella replied, her voice unnaturally calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the assassin felt ice flood his veins.He looked down to find a delicate needle protruding from his chest. Its tip gleamed black with poison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assassin crumpled to the muddy ground,agony consuming his body. He screamed into the storm, &#34;What... what have you done to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gazed down at his writhing form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a lethal toxin. Once it enters your bloodstream, it tears your heart apart from the inside-until the pain kills you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You... you deceived me!&#34; the assassin gasped,blood trickling from his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your technique was impressive,&#34; Arabella said with detached indifference, &#34;but you made one fatal mistake. You underestimated your opponent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knelt beside him, searched his pockets for his phone, and used his fingerprint to unlock the device before sending a message to someone in his contacts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After wiping the phone clean, Arabella turned and disappeared into the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Gracebourne estate, Asher returned to find Arabella still absent. He had barely settled onto the couch when his phone rang with a call from Colton.&#34;The tenth-rankedassassinisdead!&#34;Colton said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you certain?&#34; Something about the lightning splitting the sky outside filled Asher with inexplicable dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable! Number ten, eliminated just like that. Who could have taken him down? The underworld grows more dangerous every day,&#34;Colton mused aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher shared his astonishment. Then he spotted a figure approaching through the downpour-a tall, slender silhouette moving through the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately ended the call and rushed to the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arabella!&#34; Asher&#39;s voice rang out as he saw her,soaked to the bone with blood staining her shoulder.His expression darkened as he swept her into his arms and carried her inside.</p>
