                <p>Arabella turned to Karlie and calmly announced,&#34;It&#39;s Karlie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah looked like she had just been slapped with cold water-utterly stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? That&#39;s impossible! It should&#39;ve been me!&#34;she burst out, completely unwilling to accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what makes you so sure?&#34; Arabella asked with a playful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;m a good dancer! It should be me! Or are you just siding with Karlie because you two are close?&#34; Sarah shot back stubbornly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Jessica walked in. &#34;I heard everything,&#34;she said. &#34;Patrick and Lailah are both officially out. Karlie will be our new team member, and Daisy&#39;s taking over as troupe leader.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie and Daisy both blinked in shock before their faces lit up with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie could hardly believe she had really made it onto the team; it felt like she had finally made her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>family proud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy, too, was over the moon about her new leadership role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Sarah sulked, clearly unwilling to let it go. &#34;Is that true, Ms. Roman? I&#39;ve got the most experience.Why Karlie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jessica gave her a chilly look. &#34;&#39;I&#39;ve been watching. Karlie stays behind to rehearse.You?You clock out the second practice ends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah&#39;s face darkened in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had known there was a real shot, she might have pushed harder-harder than Karlie even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the team reshuffled, rehearsal began with fresh energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around three in the afternoon, Jessica clapped her hands and smiled. &#34;Great work today,everyone. Go home early and rest up. Give your best at the show-it&#39;s just two days away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, ma&#39;am!&#34; The group echoed cheerfully as they began to pack up and leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie clung to Arabella&#39;s arm with a grin. &#34;You&#39;re amazing! You knew about their affair all along,didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella nodded with a soft hum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Karlie said, her voice fulI of emotion.&#34;I never imagined I&#39;d actually make the team. My parents are going to be so proud when they hear the news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s eyes softened. &#34;Yes, they&#39;ll be proud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the moment between them, Daisy felt a bit annoyed but she didn&#39;t show it. In a pleasant voice, she suggested, &#34;Bella, how about we get something to eat? I&#39;m starting to get hungry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; Arabella nodded. Then she turned to Karlie,&#34;Want to come with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely!&#34; Karlie said with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trio headed to Avalon, where Arabella ordered the restaurant&#39;s signature dishes for them. Karlie was shocked to learn that the elegant, high-end restaurant was actually owned by Arabella. &#34;I had no idea you came from such a wealthy family,&#34; she exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a small smile. &#34;Something like that.Don&#39;t worry,though-everything here&#39;s light and healthy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is so good!&#34; Daisy said, smiling. &#34;Your recipes are a hit, Bella.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, it actually tastes healthy and good!&#34; Karlie said excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing them enjoy the food made Arabella smile too. It felt like she had just made another true friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short while later, she spotted an unfamiliar face moving around the restaurant and called the manager over. &#34;Is that a new waitress?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, business has picked up lately, so l&#39;ve brought on more staff,&#34; the manager explained.&#34;Is something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s eyes followed the young waitress moving efficiently between tables. She seemed capable-quick on her feet and attentive. &#34;No issues,&#34; she replied. &#34;Just make sure everything&#39;s shut off by eleven, leave only the kitchen running,and prep tomorrow&#39;s food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; the manager said, though he seemed slightly confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t that part of their usual routine?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a light wave, signaling him to go,and he walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time they finished eating, it was barely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>past four.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With some unexpected free time on her hands,Arabella decided to treat them to a trip to the amusement park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy and Karlie, who hadn&#39;t been to an amusement park in ages, were bubbling with excitement. Arabella stayed behind, watching them from a nearby bench as they spun on the carousel. Their laughter made her smnile, even if she didn&#39;t join in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the thought crossed her mind, Arabella pulled out her phone and texted Asher, &#34;Not coming back for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher replied quickly, &#34;Okay. Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With Daisy and Karlie at an amusement park,&#34;she responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His answer was short as always, &#34;All right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never said much, but he always replied when it came to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Daisy and Karlie finished, they each grabbed one of Arabella&#39;s arms, chatting and laughing as they pulled her along. Arabella wasn&#39;t used to being around such cheerful energy; it felt new but nice. Then came the invitation. &#34;Come</p>
                
                
                
                <p>play with us,&#34; they chimed in unison, their eyes sparkling with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella smiled but quickly shook her head. &#34;I think I&#39;ll pass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It did look fun, but to her, it felt a little too childish and not quite her thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you ever even been on one before?&#34; Karlie asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not once,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then it&#39;s time you try,&#34; Daisy grinned. &#34;Let&#39;s go on the roller coaster. I&#39;ll protect you, Bella!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella didn&#39;t really want to, but against their pleading eyes, she gave in and let them drag her along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone looked nervous as the roller coaster climbed higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy reached out and grabbed Arabella&#39;s hand.&#34;If you get scared, just squeeze my hand,&#34; she said with a reassuring smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a quiet nod.&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The roller coaster began its slow climb, then suddenly dropped, sending everyone into a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>frenzy. Screams filled the air as Karlie and Daisy shrieked at the top of their lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every twist and drop, the noise only got louder. Arabella, however, sat still, her face calm despite the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the ride finally ended, people staggered off, queasy and breathless. Arabella stepped off like nothing happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding back her own nausea, Karlie stared at her in disbelief. &#34;Arabella, you&#39;re like a robot!&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A robot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t even flinch!&#34; Karlie exclaimed. &#34;Let&#39;s try the haunted house next!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella was dragged along by the two of them and ended up trying a few more rides, though it was clear she wasn&#39;t too eager. Even the ones that were supposed to be thrilling didn&#39;t seem to faze her at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the end of it, Karlie and Daisy were buzzing with excitement, laughing and out of breath.Arabella, on the other hand, looked just the same -calm and quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t there anything you actually enjoy?&#34; Karlie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>finally asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy glanced at Arabella too, her brows drawn together in concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Arabella stayed so detached made Daisy wonder-had something happened in her life that left her this numb?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella paused, then realized she didn&#39;t really have a favorite thing. Nothing came to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about me,&#34; she said. &#34;Go have fun.I&#39;ve got a few things to check on anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She settled onto a nearby bench.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that she meant it, Karlie and Daisy let her be and headed off on their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the sun began to set, Arabella sat on the bench, her figure looking a little lonely in the middle of the busy amusement park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far off, someone noticed her and was caught off guard by how striking she looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she was busy looking through some papers for Vanguard Group, a voice suddenly spoke up.&#34;Hi, I&#39;ve been watching you for a while.Mind if we exchange contacts?&#34;</p>
