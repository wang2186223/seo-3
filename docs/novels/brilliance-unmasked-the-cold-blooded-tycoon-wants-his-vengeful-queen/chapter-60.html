                <p>Bennie was thinking along the same lines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden turned to Bennie and asked, &#34;Are your kids here yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny and Joyce had already arrived and were mingling with some of the talented young guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennie had not been able to reach Elissa, and Khloe chose not to attend since her facial scars had not fully healed. He answered, &#34;The kids are busy with a few things tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden gave him a playful nudge. &#34;What could possibly be more important than this gathering?Both your daughters are pretty. Maybe Mr.Gordon will take an interest in one of them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would be quite a fortunate turn of events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennie laughed and replied, &#34;You&#39;re joking, Mr.Hyde. There&#39;s no way Mr. Gordon would be interested in my girls. They might be bright,but in these circles, that is not always enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Bennie dreamed of such possibilities, he knew his family did not hold much sway in high society.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan stood by, keeping an eye on Joyce and Kenny from afar, and let out a quiet sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He truly wanted Joyce to meet someone outstanding, especially now that the Hyde family was no longer as powerful and would soon need more support. He could not help but worry that they were not the best option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the conversation flowed, no one noticed that Asher had already entered the venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than use the main entrance, he had chosen a private corridor that led straight to an exclusive suite on the third floor, where he could look down on the entire second-floor banquet hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the private room, Asher found himself surrounded by familiar faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he walked in with Arabella, every person in the room turned their heads in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton was especially shocked. &#34;Wait,you two actually know each other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave him a polite nod. &#34;Good evening,Mr.Russell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After greeting Colton, Arabella offered a polite nod to the rest of the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her graceful presence and striking looks immediately won over the room, and several people gave Asher playful looks. &#34;We always thought Asher just wasn&#39;t interested in dating.Turns out, his standards are just a littletoo high,&#34;one of them said teasingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s voice took on a firm edge. &#34;Don&#39;t talk nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But wwhen he glanced at Arabella, a rare softness appeared in his eyes. &#34;If you get bored,you can go downstairs and grab something to eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella nodded in agreement. &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation soon shifted to the upcoming bidding event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since everyone here came from influential families, they wanted to avoid letting the competition hurt their relationships. They needed to decide which projects each family</p>
                
                
                
                <p>would take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella sat quietly for a while before deciding to excuse herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, as soon as she left the room,she spotted Kenny making his way toward the terrace. She narrowed her eyes, curious about what business Kenny had stepping out in the middle of such an important evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved quietly, following at a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The banquet was just getting underway, so the terrace was completely empty. Kenny checked to make sure no one was around before answering his phone. &#34;I know, baby. I believe you. Try not to let it get to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Baby? That was definitely unexpected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was inside attending the event, so whoever Kenny was calling had to be someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella watched him closely, her suspicion growing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real reason for Kenny&#39;s relationship with Joyce came down to the Lambert family&#39;s</p>
