                <p>Nothing in Arabella&#39;s life had prepared her for someone as shameless as Meagan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her voice even. &#34;The villa has already been sold. If you&#39;re still there after Sunday, don&#39;t blame me for what happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, Arabella ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan glared at her phone, fuming over the call that had just ended. She tried calling back, but there was no answer. Rage spiled out as she muttered to herself, &#34;That bitch! If she ever comes back, I&#39;ll show her what real discipline is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the couch, Khloe lounged in front of the TV,admiring herself in her phone screen&#39;s reflection.The scars on her face had faded a lot, just as she had been promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity got the better of Khloe. &#34;Who was that,Mom? Was it Arabella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan gave a cold smile. &#34;Of course it was. That little bitch actually told us to get out. She claims</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she sold the villa. I&#39;d like to see who&#39;s bold enough to buy it. Whoever they are, I&#39;ll make sure the deal falls apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe hardly looked worried. &#34;We&#39;re not leaving.Let&#39;s see if anyone actually dares to buy the house!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plans were already in motion. If someone did show up, they intended to spread rumors about the place being haunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk curled Khloe&#39;s lips. &#34;Arabella is just too naive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression turned brighter as she remembered something. &#34;By the way, tomorrow is Elissa&#39;s big rehearsal. A lot of important people will be there. Can I go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Elissa, a smile broke through Meagan&#39;s irritation. &#34;We can&#39;t just waltz in, but after it&#39;s over, we can pay her a visit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made Khloe beam. &#34;That&#39;s great! I&#39;m going to start live streaming again, Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her face healed, she finally felt ready to return to streaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on then,&#34; Meagan answered, applying a fresh face mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t take Arabella&#39;s words seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day arrived, bringing rehearsal day at Griridge Theatre.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella and Karlie sat among the audience when a familiar voice called out, &#34;Daisy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze lifted to see Kenzie and several others walking over. A few dance students had been invited to watch, and by coincidence, Kenzie ended up right beside Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sightof Arabella left Kenzie speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock hit her when she realized Arabella was unscathed. Weren&#39;t Maryam&#39;s people supposed to have taken her away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie couldn&#39;t hold back. &#34;How did you manage to get out?&#34; Her face twisted with mixed emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you even care?&#34; Arabella asked sharply,her voice laced with scorn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answer left Kenzie irritated and even more annoyed. She scanned Arabella up and down,letting out a mocking laugh. &#34;Have you been planning payback while you were away? Like l said before, you can try all you want, but you&#39;ll never take on Joyce and her friends. Poor girls</p>
                
                
                
                <p>like you stay poor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smug smile crossed her lips. &#34;If you beg me right now, maybe I&#39;ll speak up for you and get Joyce to go easy on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Joyce&#39;s influence behind her, Kenzie had no problem throwing her weight around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a half smile. &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie said, &#34;Then get down and apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie&#39;s phone appeared in her hand. Arabella could tell this wasn&#39;t the first time Daisy had been pushed into this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Kenzie sneered. So Daisy still hadn&#39;t changed, and she was just as timid as before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Due to her humble beginnings, she was stuck tagging along behind Elissa&#39;s circle. The only way she could feed her fragile ego was by belittling Daisy whenever she got the chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden crash echoed through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something had smacked into Kenzie&#39;s knee,making her collapse to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of humor danced in Arabella&#39;s eyes as she looked down. &#34;You&#39;re pretty skilled at begging. Must be second nature by now. Or</p>
                
                
                
                <p>maybe it&#39;s just because Elissa and Joyce have never let you stand up for yourself, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie&#39;s face drained of color. &#34;You witch! How dare you pull this on me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie chimed in, &#34;The performance is about to start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, the stage lights dimmed, and Kenzie had no choice but to hold back her anger,silently vowing to get even with Arabella later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration simmered inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Kenzie&#39;s mind, Daisy&#39;s stubbornness was the reason she kept landing in trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a minute passed before the dance performance got underway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dancers moved with such grace that the entire audience sat entranced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Occasionally, someone whispered, &#34;Isn&#39;t this one of Isabella&#39;s pieces? It&#39;s really stunning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely, Isabella is truly remarkable, and she stands among the finest dancers in the country.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elissa&#39;s solo is amazing too!&#34; someone added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, she choreographed it herself. That takes real skill,&#34; another person replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s solo performance quickly drew its own share of attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the last note faded, the audience broke into applause and words of praise filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was incredible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elissa&#39;s solo was especially impressive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The younger dancers are surpassing the veterans these days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cheers and compliments followed Elissa as she took her bow and exited the stage, her face glowing with pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie&#39;s eyes darkened as she turned and gave Arabella a smug look. &#34;Did you see that, Daisy?That&#39;s the difference between you and Elissa.You&#39;ll always be stuck here in the audience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold look settled on Arabella&#39;s face. &#34;And what about you? No matter how talented Elissa is,you&#39;re still just plain old Kenzie. It&#39;s almost laughable, the way you hide behind someone else&#39;s achievements just to feel important.&#34;</p>
