                <p>&#34;I need your chefs,&#34; Asher said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cecily raised a brow. &#34;How many are we talking about? I&#39;ll have them reassigned immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All of them,&#34; he replied bluntly. &#34;You&#39;ll have to hire replacements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for her response, he hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cecily&#39;s expression turned sour. That ungrateful boy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned just in time to see the butler escorting the chefs out-each one of them world-class,handpicked at a hefty price. And now, Asher was snatching them all away without a second thought. Who was gonna cook for her now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as she fumed, a thought struck her. Asher had never cared much for luxury meals. He wasn&#39;t the type to steal chefs just to enjoy fine dining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he... planning to open a restaurant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her suspicion grew. Something was definitely up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the Gracebourne villa, Asher had just finished settling the restaurant arrangements when he stepped through the door, only to find Arabella and Daisy coming downstairs, dragging their suitcases behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped in his tracks. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy shot him a glare. &#34;You&#39;re getting engaged to someone else, remember? Obviously, we&#39;re moving out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Arabella. &#34;Is that how you see it too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s expression was unreadable, her tone flat. &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher stared at her for a moment, then quietly reached out and took her hand. &#34;Come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy could only grit her teeth as she watched the two of them walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside Asher&#39;s room, Arabella immediately pulled her hand back. &#34;Say whatever it is you want to say and get it over with,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she said icily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher just gave a faint smile, which only made her more irritated. She turned to walk away, but</p>
                
                
                
                <p>before she could take a step, he wrapped his arms around her from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His familiar scent surrounded her, and for a moment, Arabella froze. Then she started to struggle as his breath brushed softly against her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| won&#39;t lie-I did consider marrying Rosie once,&#34;he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw clenched. &#34;Then go ahead. Marry her.That&#39;s none of my business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Asher didn&#39;t loosen his hold. &#34;I met with her today to end it properly. There&#39;s no engagement.She brought paparazzi, but I made her set the record straight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s resistance faltered slightly, though her face was still tense. Then, without warning, she felt a soft, warm brush against her cheek. She turned sharply and met Asher&#39;s eyes, shining with intensity and something deeper she couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; she snapped,her voice low and guarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher lightly brushed her cheek again. &#34;You&#39;re blushing,&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swatted his hand aside. &#34;Shameless,&#34; she muttered, irritation flaring in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, Asher let out a low chuckle, the sound rumbling through his chest-it was strangely captivating. &#34;You&#39;re seriously adorable,&#34;he teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a jerk! He was clearly enjoying this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her hand, ready to smack him, but he didn&#39;t even flinch and just stood there, watching her with eyes so gentle it caught her off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the end, her hand fell. She took a breath and said coolly, &#34;You may not be marrying her,but sooner or later you&#39;ll marry someone. It&#39;s only right for us to move out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of frustration passed through Asher&#39;s eyes.He went quiet for a moment, then asked in a soft voice, &#34;Have you ever wondered why I never left your side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s brows drew together in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At first, it was out of obligation-my father asked me to look after you and Daisy,&#34; he said honestly.&#34;But then... I couldn&#39;t stop watching you. The more I saw, the more I got pulled in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes held hers, and she felt like the air in the room had shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was burning now. She wasn&#39;t used to this kind of intimacy, wasn&#39;t used to feeling anything like this, but strangely, she didn&#39;t mind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her teeth grazed her lip as she stayed quiet, not knowing what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher went on, &#34;Over time, I realized I wanted to do more for you-to help you let go of all the anger and just live a peaceful, happy life. And honestly, seeing you smile... that makes me happy too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never fallen for anyone before, but when it came to Arabella, his feelings were undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s cheeks flushed deeper, her heart thudding a little faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There was a time I thought love didn&#39;t matter and that marriage was just a transaction,&#34; he said,his voice firm now. &#34;But I was wrong. If I can&#39;t be with the person I truly love, then l&#39;d rather not marry at all.&#34;</p>
