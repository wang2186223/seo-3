                <p>A soft sigh escaped Elissa before she leaned in and spoke. &#34;You&#39;ve always been in Daisy&#39;s corner, Kaitlyn. But honestly, don&#39;t you see her true colors by now? She&#39;s more skilled than you think at flirting with guys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint bite to her lower lip was Kaitlyn&#39;s only sign of uncertainty as she answered, her tone frosty, &#34;I don&#39;t buy it. Daisy isn&#39;t like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a roll of her eyes, Joyce jumped in to back Elissa up. &#34;You&#39;ll see soon enough. Just wait until she shows you who she really is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, frustration simmered in Joyce-Elissa had lied to her before. Still, those tears and apologies had managed to sway her yet again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blame fell easily on Daisy, especially since she had actually tried making a move on her boyfriend.There was no way to deny it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of talking sense into Daisy, Arabella had chosen to pick a fight with her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given that kind of spiteful behavior, Elissa&#39;s dishonesty almost made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s unbelievable,&#34; Joyce muttered through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa couldn&#39;t help but chuckle in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity got the better of Joyce. &#34;Doesn&#39;t this make you mad,Elissa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an air of calm, Elissa just shrugged. &#34;No need to worry-what&#39;s right will win in the end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in a private dining room, Colton watched Arabella as if he had stumbled across a rare gem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That didn&#39;t go unnoticed by Asher, whose mood darkening with every passing moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the silence, Colton addressed Arabella,offering, &#34;You&#39;ve really got a spark. Why not join my company? I&#39;d make sure you have every opportunity you could want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her answer came with a polite smile. &#34;That&#39;s very generous, Mr. Russell, but I&#39;m not looking for a job at the moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment flickered in Colton&#39;s eyes. &#34;With your drive, you could run your own company one day. And if you ever do, let me know. I&#39;d love to invest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The compliment left Arabella feeling just a bit uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only he knew her own company was already thriving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Switching gears, Asher placed some food onto Arabella&#39;s plate. &#34;Let&#39;s just eat,&#34; he said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua wandered over right then, plopping down next to Arabella with a grin. &#34;Well, look who&#39;s here! You could&#39;ve told me you&#39;d be attending the lecture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella met his question with a shrug. &#34;You didn&#39;t mention you&#39;d be here either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin spread across Joshua&#39;s face. &#34;I happened to have some time, that&#39;s all. Do you want to order anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s eyebrows shot up in surprise. &#34;Do you know her, Mr. Willis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pride was clear in Joshua&#39;s response. &#34;Of course</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a knowing nod, Colton added, &#34;I thought as much. Someone with her talent is bound to stand out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Arabella. &#34;Let&#39;s trade numbers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick flick of her wrist brought out Arabella&#39;s phone,and they exchanged contact information without fuss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Juggling conversation from Colton and Joshua left Arabella barely a moment to herself, as she bounced from one question to another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher ate in silence, his expression brooding.Nobody paid his mood much attention, Colton,for one, was used to seeing himn that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for a way to smooth things over,Arabella suggested, &#34;Would you like something to drink,Asher?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question caught Asher&#39;s attention, and whatever shadow he had been under seemed to lift. His answer came gently. &#34;Coffee would be perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and quickly bought him a cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton eyed his good friend with curiosity,wondering what had changed to lighten Asher&#39;s mood so suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side of the table, Joshua quietly took in the exchange, noting just how different Asher was around Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When lunch wrapped up, Joshua and Arabella slipped away together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stroll around campus gave them a chance to unwind, and soon they found a bench to sit and talk. Joshua leaned back, breaking the comfortable silence. &#34;You know, Mr. Gordon&#39;s support could mean big things for our company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a calm, even tone, Arabella replied, &#34;His help is only because of a promise he made to his father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua pressed on, &#34;If he&#39;s that willing to help you, maybe he&#39;d support us as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot him a firm look. &#34;Let&#39;s drop the subject. If there&#39;s ever a need for us to work together, we&#39;ll go through official channels.Don&#39;t chase after partnerships with Asher on your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua&#39;s enthusiasm fizzled. &#34;Got it, boss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few steps away, Asher and Colton had just arrived, pausing as they spotted Joshua and Arabella together. Colton muttered, &#34;Didn&#39;t we just finish eating? What are we doing back out here? Wait-isn&#39;t that Mr. Willis with Arabella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood there, unsure if they should approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he overheard Arabella and Joshua&#39;s exchange, Asher&#39;s expression softened, a warm light flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton could hardly believe what he was seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dynamic between Asher and Arabella was turning out to be something he hadn&#39;t expected at all. Hearing Joshua casually call her &#34;boss&#34;made everything suddenly click; no wonder she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>had turned down his company offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, something just came to mind.&#34; From out of nowhere, Joshua perked up, an idea sparking in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella had a bad feeling about what he was going to say but gave him a nod to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a grin, Joshua suggested, &#34;Why not just go for Asher? If you two were together, there wouldn&#39;t be any awkward boundaries left between you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The minute those words left his mouth, he met a frosty glare from Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Joshua continued, &#34;I get that love isn&#39;t really your thing, but that&#39;s exactly why you and Asher would work. Neither of you wants romance, you both stand out from the crowd ... Sounds like a perfect match made in heaven,if you ask me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole conversation struck Colton as completely absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Joshua thinking? He was seriously</p>
                
                
                
                <p>contemplating setting Asher and Arabella up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to admit she was impressive, but Asher wasn&#39;t the type to bother with relationships. In fact,Asher never seemed interested in anyone,least of all women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A joke started to form on Colton&#39;s tongue, but glancing over at Asher, he noticed something odd-those famously cool eyes had softened,and the tips of his ears were tinged with red.Asher looked lost in his own thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight left Colton reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Asher actually considering what Joshua had just said?</p>
