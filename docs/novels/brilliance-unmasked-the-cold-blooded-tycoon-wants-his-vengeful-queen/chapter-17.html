                <p>Arabella&#39;s partner noticed her gaze and gave her a light elbow. &#34;Stop staring. We&#39;re nowhere near their league. The pros have talent and serious hookups. Elissa&#39;s on another level-she&#39;s young and already made it into the Griridge Troupe. Her dancing&#39;s sharp, and her routines? Next level.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? She&#39;s got those freestyle parts figured out already?&#34; Arabella asked, sounding mildly interested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what sets her apart. There&#39;s a solo section where we have to freestyle, and while we&#39;re all still piecing things together, she&#39;s already nailed hers. See that part there?&#34; Her partner let out a sigh. &#34;Everyone&#39;s so polished.I&#39;m probably stuck in the background for life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked totally defeated, like she had accepted being a forever backup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella didn&#39;t say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daisy?&#34; Elissa&#39;s voice rang out as she approached with a syrupy smile. &#34;Hey, Daisy!Glad you&#39;re here. Are you holding up alright? I was honestly worried the training might be a bit much since it&#39;s been a while since you danced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turned to look at Arabella. One dancer mumbled, &#34;Wait, she&#39;s been out of it for that long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers started flying-how did someone who hadn&#39;t danced in ages end up as a substitute?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa gave a dramatic gasp, covering her mouth.&#34;Oops, that came out wrong! Daisy&#39;s got a leg condition, but it&#39;s no big deal-she can still dance just fine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she explained, the more annoyed people looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had barely trained and had a leg issue, but she still made it in? That smelled like favoritism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To them, nothing stung more than someone getting ahead through connections instead of effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them rolled their eyes and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few others just gave dirty looks and turned their backs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella didn&#39;t panic. Instead,she smirked a little.&#34;Well played, Elissa. You&#39;ve got them all buying whatever you&#39;re selling again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa was smug inside, but her voice was full of fake guilt. &#34;Aw, I didn&#39;t mean to cause a scene.I&#39;ll watch my words next time, I swear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s kind of your signature move-slip-ups that always end up hurting me,&#34; Arabella replied evenly. &#34;No need to apologize. But you might want to think twice, since throwing shade at me means doubting Jennifer&#39;s decision too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s smile twitched for just a moment,her mask slipping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s partner finally spoke up. &#34;I danced with her. She&#39;s actually incredible, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turned to look at Elissa again, this time with more doubt in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands started to sweat, but she stuck to playing the innocent. &#34;It was an honest mistake!You really think I&#39;d go out of my way to mess with you? C&#39;mon,Daisy-you&#39;re not even competition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe jumped in right away. &#34;Yeah, Daisy, get over yourself. Not everyone&#39;s plotting against you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa gave a shake of her head, acting like she was hurt, then turned and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest trailed after her, glancing back at Daisy with a mix of judgment and uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s partner turned to her with concern written all over her face. &#34;Are youalright,Daisy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella looked at her calmly. &#34;What&#39;s your name,by the way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Karlie Alford.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice,&#34; Arabella replied, her tone cool. &#34;You aiming for the main squad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the showcase getting closer, everyone threw themselves into practice once the break ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long, tiring session, thesubstitute dancers slowly packed up and left,drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Arabella and Karlie stayed behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll show you how it&#39;s done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella danced the whole routine smoothly for Karlie to watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was done, Karlie stood frozen,her mouth hanging open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella hadn&#39;t been showing her fulI potential before. What she just did made the main team look average.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop spacing out. Get moving!&#34; Arabella&#39;s sharp voice jolted Karlie back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping out of it, she dove right into practice,pushing herself to match Arabella&#39;s drive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though they were both exhausted, Karlie didn&#39;t let up. She was locked in, totally focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Karlie give it her all made Arabella think of Daisy-she must HAve pushed herself just as hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still going,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Elissa&#39;s voice rang out from the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She strolled in slowly, her smile twisted and mean now that they were alone. &#34;Train all you want,Daisy, but it won&#39;t change a thing. Losers stay losers. If hard work really worked, talent wouldn&#39;t matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, so you&#39;re pure talent now?&#34; Arabella said,tilting her head with a sarcastic grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie looked stunned. She hadn&#39;t expected Elissa to be this nasty.</p>
