                <p>&#34;Are you people seriously losing it? Daisy lives at Elissa&#39;s house and still bullies her. Joyce and her girls weren&#39;t out of line-they were defending Elissa!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly.I&#39;m with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella quietly opened a fresh account and clapped back, &#34;Wait, but Daisy never broke Elissa&#39;s leg. Elissa puts on this act like she&#39;s all kind and caring, but it&#39;s just a mask. Every time Joyce picked on Daisy, Elissa stood by like it wasn&#39;t her problem. If Elissa were really the victim, then why is she still all glammed up while Daisy looks like she got dragged through hell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One user wrote, &#34;Damn. That makes so much sense now. Elissa&#39;s always low-key manipulating people to go after Daisy. That&#39;s some next-level mean girl energy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always thought Elissa was manipulative,&#34;another added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I once saw Joyce literally beating Daisy in a hallway, and Elissa just stood there watching.Like,seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The posts hit a nerve, and people couldn&#39;t stop thinking about them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other hand, Elissa saw the posts and lost it. With a scream of frustration, she swept everything off her vanity-the clatter of palettes and perfume bottles crashing to the floor filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was furious at how quickly everyone seemed to buy into the narrative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what was up with Daisy? It felt like she had flipped into a totally different person overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa could feel her carefully built image falling apart in real time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That two-faced snake,&#34; she thought,seething.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate to get answers, she called her mom,but the second the call connected, she was hit with the sound of sobbing. &#34;Mom?&#34; Elissa&#39;s voice sharpened. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vanguard just ended all cooperation with us.We&#39;ve got no incoming cash now. I don&#39;t know what to do,&#34; Meagan cried, on the verge of panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s mind reeled. &#34;That can&#39;t be. Didn&#39;t they think highly of Dad? Out of everyone in Griridge,they chose him to lead their top projects!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t explain it,&#34; Meagan replied. &#34;Your dad and I are going to talk to them.Elissa,come with us if you can.&#34; Of course, Meagan had her own plan brewing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa had the looks and the charm, so Meagan was hoping the president of Vanguard Group might notice. If he did, it could solve all their problems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second Elissa thought of the mysterious</p>
                
                
                
                <p>president of Vanguard Group, she didn&#39;t even think twice. &#34;Count me in,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after she ended the call, Elissa realized she had completely forgotten to bring up Daisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Screw it. I&#39;ll handle that snake on my own,&#34; she growled under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow passed over Elissa&#39;s face as she picked up her phone and began typing, her fingers moving fast and furiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the quiet hospital room, Arabella sat beside Daisy, watching her silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s short hair was uneven and tangled,and her face was still covered in bruises. Even with all the care Arabella had given her, she still looked beaten and fragile. Arabella reached out and softly touched Daisy&#39;s cold cheek, not even realizing the tears that had started sliding down her own face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Daisy&#39;s phone lit up with a buzz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an old phone, clearly a few generations behind. Arabella struggled briefly before managing to open the video message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, Daisy, you&#39;re all bones-except those boobs!&#34; The video showed a bathroom scene.Daisy was on her knees, curled uup tightly and holding herself. Three or four women surrounded her, pulling at her clothes, most of which were already ripped. Their faces were twisted with smug, cruel smiles. Joyce stood among them, laughing loudly. &#34;Just look at you,Daisy. What are you hoping for, some prince to rescue your filthy ass? Get real! Who the hell would save someone like you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s voice came from the side, light and almost playful. &#34;Alright, that&#39;s enough, Joyce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce rolled her eyes. &#34;Elissa, you&#39;re too soft.Honestly, where would you be without us? I&#39;m teaching this little bitch a lesson today-rip it all off!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The camera wobbled as the one filming burst</p>
                
                
                
                <p>out laughing, but it stayed trained on Daisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please! Stop! I&#39;m begging you!&#34; Her desperate pleas only seemed to egg them on further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce howled with laughter, while Elissa&#39;s lips twitched into a slight smirk before she forced on a frown. &#34;Joyce, you&#39;re awful,&#34; she said with fake disapproval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage surged through Arabella, but she clenched her fists and forced herself to watch to the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girls yanked off the last of Daisy&#39;s clothes.She screamed, completely exposed and trembling. Laughing like it was all some twisted game, they poured dirty water over her,ignoring her cries for help.</p>
