                <p>&#34;I have,&#34; Asher answered right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton said, &#34;I&#39;ll admit, Miss Stanley is impressive,but don&#39;t underestimate the Hudson family. If you walk away from Rosie this easily, they might not let it go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher responded in a steady, commanding tone,&#34;And what if they don&#39;t? What couldthey possibly do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton fell quiet. The truth was, the Hudson family couldn&#39;t compete with the Gordons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he couldn&#39;t shake the thought that it was a bold move to fall out with them so openly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning the tables, Asher asked, &#34;And what about you? Hasn&#39;t your grandmother been pushing you lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s smile faded for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, an image of a young, gentle girl flickered in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He forced the thought away and replied with a shrug, &#34;I&#39;m not rushing to get married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, Arabella needed to pick Daisy up in the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Along the way, she crossed paths with Karlie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sight of two identical Daisys, Karlie stared in surprise, but she recovered quickly. &#34;You must be Arabella!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella nodded. &#34;Looks like Daisy filled you in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie grinned. &#34;The resemblance is obvious. You and Daisy really are twins!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft smile touched Arabella&#39;s lips. &#34;Good observation.How have you been holding up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question made Karlie look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The performance was drawing closer, and despite Arabella&#39;s promise about a full-time spot, nothing had changed yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie had been practicing until late every night before heading home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing&#39;s different,&#34; Karlie said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella squeezed her shoulder gently. &#34;I meant what I told you. Be patient-I&#39;ll keep my promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Karlie studied her, then nodded with resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She already knew what the twins had been through and felt that Arabella was someone she could trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, Daisy and Arabella got in the car to head home. Daisy filled the ride with stories about her day while Arabella listened, lost in thought,until the car rolled to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy watched Asher step out of the car,confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came back a few minutes later, holding a custom cake in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella spotted the bakery&#39;s logo and her eyes widened. &#34;Jen&#39;s Bakery... Aren&#39;t their products always booked solid for weeks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher handed her the box. &#34;I don&#39;t need a reservation. You&#39;ve been busy all day, so try some cake first. Dinner&#39;s waiting at home, too.&#34; His voice grew gentler as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile touched Arabella&#39;s lips. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy pulled a face for a second, but quickly asked, &#34;How did it go today? Was it a big hit?saw Felix posting about your restaurant. You actually know him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something like that,&#34; Arabella answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s eyes sparkled. &#34;Is he as cute in person as he seems online?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s cute,&#34; Arabella said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy was relentless. &#34;But is he as handsome as Asher?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The steering wheel creaked under Asher&#39;s grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella replied from the back, sounding cool and unbothered, &#34;They have their own styles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy let out a laugh. &#34;So, whose style do you like more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s knuckles tightened again. He was silent but hanging on her answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to know the truth as much as anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella hesitated, thinking over her response-then Asher interjected, &#34;You should eat your cake before it gets too soft.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the topic shifted, and Arabella exhaled softly, glad for the interruption. She tried a bite,and the cake really did melt on her tongue, sweet and light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher eased up a little, keeping his eyes on the road, but sweat still clung to his palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never imagined a girl would take up so much space in his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, after they finished a good meal to her place, Arabella spoke to Asher. &#34;Our chefs have everything running smoothly now. Shouldn&#39;t your mother&#39;s chefs head back to her place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher kept his tone calm. &#34;No rush. Let them stay at the restaurant for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella looked at him curiously. &#34;Won&#39;t your mom need her chefs back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed unruffled. &#34;She&#39;s fine. She is on diet food anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella blinked in surprise. She always thought wealthy families never worried about gaining weight. After all, none of them ever seemed out of shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over at the Gordon family&#39;s mansion, Cecily stared down at her dinner, her appetite nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured to herself, &#34;When are the chefs coming home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lost interest in her food, pulled out her phone,and scrolled through social media. Right away,she spotted a Twitter post from her son, Asher,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>advertising a new restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this restaurant belong to Asher? Cecily&#39;s curiosity spiked right away. If she came here, she could finally eat real food again and show her support for Asher&#39;s venture at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By eleven the next morning, Cecily was standing at the restaurant entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking in the impressive design, she muttered to herself, &#34;Only my son could open a place like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cecily walked in and caught a server talking to a woman. &#34;Boss, everything is nearly set.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s wonderful. Make sure every guest is looked after,&#34; Arabella answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and caught sight of Cecily.&#34;Welcome!Will you be dining alone or with others?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cecily stopped in her tracks when she saw Arabella&#39;s face, startled by the familiarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella waited a beat, then asked, &#34;Ma&#39;am, how many are in your party?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cecily finally found her voice. &#34;Are you the owner here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s right,&#34; Arabella answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cecily&#39;s expression shifted through several emotions before she answered in an even tone,&#34;Just me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave her a polite nod. &#34;Please follow me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cecily settled at her table and ordered severa of the signature dishes, all the while watching Arabella move around the room. The resemblance was almost uncanny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her food arrived, Cecily tasted each dish and found every biteboth flavorful and healthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be the work of their family&#39;s chefs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Cecily wondered why Asher had sent them here. The reason escaped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe... something was going on between Asher and the owner? But she quickly dismissed the idea-it must be business, nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cecily couldn&#39;t imagine the girl having a deeper connection with Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Arabella was busy checking on the staff and making sure the restaurant ran smoothly when her phone rang. Karlie&#39;s voice was frantic</p>
                
                
                
                <p>on the line. &#34;Arabella, something&#39;s happened!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s in trouble!&#34;</p>
