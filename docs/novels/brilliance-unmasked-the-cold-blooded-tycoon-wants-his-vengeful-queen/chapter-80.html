                <p>Arabella pressed her lips together, feeling a strange tension building inside her, but she decided to speak up anyway. &#34;Thank you for everything you&#39;ve done for us these last few days. I won&#39;t forget how kind you&#39;ve been.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What now?&#34; Asher&#39;s eyes turned cold in an instant, and a sharp edge crept into his demeanor, as if he already knew what Arabella would say next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a breath and continued, &#34;I think it&#39;s best if Daisy and I find a place of our own. We can&#39;t keep relying on you forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression remained frosty, his voice flat.&#34;Is that what you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m sure...&#34; Arabella managed to say,but Asher had already turned his back and walked away before she finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy feeling surged in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no idea what Asher was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking in two strangers must have been a hassle for him, right? Shouldn&#39;t he feel relieved now that they were leaving?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind drifted as she got back to her room,eyes unfocused while she stared at her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News was spreading quickly online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Tucker Group, the Hyde Group, and even the Lambert Group were all facing heavy boycotts. However, since Joyce issued an apology right away and Nathan made a donation of twenty million, they were not hit as hard as the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Griridge University also sent Arabella financial compensation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was falling into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With things here settling down, she knew it was time to focus on the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella thought about a certain name, her eyes narrowing as she called Joshua. &#34;How are things going with the assignment I gave you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. Everything&#39;s moving along just fine. But what made you want to start a restaurant all of a sudden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella answered in a steady voice, &#34;I started thinking about those years | spent in the lab,always working and never really tasting good food. After I left, I finally discovered how many wonderful things there are to eat. Still, a lot of people have stomach problems. I want to create meals that can help them feel better. And,honestly, there&#39;s someone in that neighborhood I haven&#39;t forgiven yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua perked up. &#34;I get it! That sounds amazing. I&#39;m handling the renovations at the restaurant, and it&#39;s almost finished. Do you want me to help you search for a chef?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That would be great,&#34; Arabella responded.&#34;Also, could you check on the properties listed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>under my name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua was quick to agree. &#34;Sure, but what&#39;s got you curious about that all of a sudden? Are you planning to move out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; she replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua sounded surprised. &#34;You mean it? What made you decide?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella kept her tone calm. &#34;Daisy and |shouldn&#39;t keep staying at Asher&#39;s. It isn&#39;t right to keep depending on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wants you to leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,it&#39;s my choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua was disappointed but did not try to talk her out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after Arabella ended the call, a knock echoed from the door. She walked over and opened it to find Asher standing in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light in the corridor made him look even</p>
                
                
                
                <p>more striking, shadows playing across his features. His gaze was deep and unwavering as he spoke. &#34;You gave me a gift, so I have something for you too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted his hand, and as his fingers opened,she saw her cherry blossom pendant resting in his palm. Arabella&#39;s eyes grew wide in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maryam had crushed the pendant once before,but now it looked flawless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella took it in her hands and opened the locket, seeing the photo inside completely untouched, not even a hairline crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Asher, surprise and gratitude mixing on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you ask someone to repair this for me?&#34;Her voice was full of thanks. &#34;It&#39;s perfect-just like it was before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did it myself.&#34; Asher&#39;s eyes never left her,and her heart fluttered at the thought. It amazed her that someone as busy as Asher would take time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to fix it with his own hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met his gaze, drawn in by how deep and intense it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wild possibility flickered in her mind for just a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible that Asher truly cared for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want to move out, I won&#39;t stop you. But if you&#39;d like to stay, you&#39;ll always have a place here.&#34; His voice was soft and steady as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella held the pendant close, not sure how to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Asher reached out and gently ruffled her hair. &#34;Take your time. I&#39;ll be here whenever you decide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words lingered in her mind, heavy with meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She managed a small nod, watching as Asher left the doorway. When she returned to her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>room, her thoughts spun in every direction. She had never dated anyone before, but she could sense Asher&#39;s kindness was genuine. There was something deeper in the way he looked at her,and it left her feeling breathless.</p>
