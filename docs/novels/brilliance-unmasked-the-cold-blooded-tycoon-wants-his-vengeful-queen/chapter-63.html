                <p>Feeling slowly returned to the leg that had once been numb and useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flickered across Daisy&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle smile, Arabella spoke softly. &#34;I took care of you every day while you slept.I applied ointment and used special treatments.By now, your leg should be almost as good as new.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that true?&#34; Daisy tested her leg, taking a few careful steps before bouncing lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her amazement, her leg worked perfectly again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of happiness swept through Daisy.Passing by the mirror, she stopped to touch her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reflection staring back at her was clear and soft. Could this really be her? Was her face fully healed as well?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears shimmered in Daisy&#39;s eyes. &#34;It was you who saved me,Bella.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll be healthy from now on,&#34; Arabella responded,her words filled with reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to hold back, Daisy threw her arms around Arabella and held her tight. &#34;I&#39;m so grateful to have you in my life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft laugh escaped Arabella. &#34;Those people who hurt you are going to pay for it. I&#39;ve already taken back the family property Aunt Meagan tried to steal. Everything they did-I&#39;ll make sure they regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy could only stare at Arabella in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion touched Arabella&#39;s face. &#34;What is it,Daisy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re incredible.&#34; Daisy lowered her arms,sadness clouding her eyes for a moment. &#34;You must have suffered so much to become so strong. I haven&#39;t helped at all. I just made things harder for you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of emotion washed over Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone else saw only her strength and skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy, though, always cared about how she was really holding up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve managed just fine,&#34; Arabella said gently,brushing a hand over Daisy&#39;s cheek. &#34;I&#39;m your big sister. It&#39;s my job to be strong and look after you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of determination appeared on Daisy&#39;s face. &#34;It&#39;s not fair if you&#39;re the only one looking out for me just because you&#39;re my sister.I want to be strong too. From now on, I&#39;ll protect you as well!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing those words, Arabella felt warmth blossom in her heart. &#34;All right, all right. So much has happened while you were sleeping.Come sit with me, and I&#39;ll fill you in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They settled together on the couch, and Arabella began to recount how she had gone to the school and stood up for Daisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy listened in awe, her eyes wide as she watched clips of Joyce and the others getting their comeuppance, and glanced through screenshots showing Elissa being insulted online.The expression on Daisy&#39;s face changed with each revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re amazing, Bella,&#34; Daisy said with admiration shining in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella reached out and gently smoothed Daisy&#39;s hair. &#34;Once they&#39;ve been properly punished, you&#39;ll be able to return to school.How does that sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy gave a resolute nod. &#34;I&#39;d like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s someone else I&#39;d like you to meet,&#34;Arabella added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had barely wrapped up when her phone lit up with a message from Asher. &#34;If the conversation&#39;s over, come down. Dinner&#39;s ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella smiled and took Daisy&#39;s hand. &#34;Come on. I&#39;ll keep telling you everything on the way.Asher has really helped us a lot while you were recovering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, the dining table was covered with a spread of tempting dishes. Everything was light and easy on the stomach for someone just waking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher sat at one end of the table, composed and dignified like an old-fashioned gentleman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leading Daisy over, Arabella offered an introduction. &#34;This is Asher Gordon, the person I was telling you about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With caution in her eyes, Daisy studied Asher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher held her gaze and spoke in a steady voice.&#34;Hello, Daisy. Make yourself comfortable here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy pressed her lips together, giving a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking her seat beside Daisy, Arabella glanced at the spread on the table. &#34;You really went out of your way for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher replied, &#34;Daisy just woke up, so I made sure all this food would be gentle on her stomach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile spread across Arabella&#39;s face as she nodded and helped Daisy to a serving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy began eating in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella asked, &#34;Does the sachet I gave you last time still work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy shook her head. &#34;It doesn&#39;t smell as nice anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching into her pocket, Arabella pulled out a fresh sachet. &#34;Here&#39;s a new one I made. This should be even better than before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher reached for the sachet, and for a second,his fingers brushed against hers, sending a gentle warmth between them. He brought it closer for a sniff, pleased with the scent.&#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella responded, &#34;No problem. By the way,is there any shape you like best?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked thoughtful. &#34;Shape?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella explained, &#34;Or maybe an animal? I&#39;m almost done with the thing I promised to make you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile touched Asher&#39;s lips. &#34;A cat would be nice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella felt a flicker of surprise. She had never pictured Asher as someone who liked cats, but she nodded in agreement and let it go without more questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daisy watched them closely, her eyes filled with a mix of curiosity and something bardor to nin dowi</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they finished eating, Arabella took Daisy outside for a stroll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked, Daisy held tightly to Arabella&#39;s hands. &#34;Do you think we could move out and get a place of our own?&#34;</p>
