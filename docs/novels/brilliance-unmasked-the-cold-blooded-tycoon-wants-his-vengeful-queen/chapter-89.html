                <p>Asher found Arabella&#39;s reaction endearing and chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She changed the topic. &#34;You should probably get back to the office. I&#39;ve taken up enough of your time these past days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a look, brow lifted, his smile both sly and inviting. &#34;I don&#39;t mind. You always work better when you&#39;re happy,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She missed the hint. &#34;Why are you in a better mood here at the restaurant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s because you&#39;re here,&#34; Asher replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Arabella just stared at him, warmth blooming quietly in her chest. She turned away,hiding her fluster. &#34;I need to get back to work now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher watched her leave, a smile spreading across his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found her adorable, even if she was completely oblivious to romance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he never made a move, she might never notice how he felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even someone as calm as Asher could not help feeling a little nervous. He had a sense this journey would take a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Arabella wrapped up her tasks, the sky had already darkened. She strolled toward the strip of parkway not far from the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A figure ducked behind some shrubbery, but she caught up right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing the trembling paparazzo, Arabella smiled with mischief. &#34;No need to be afraid. I just want you to pass on a message.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-what kind of message?&#34; the paparazzo stammered, surprised by how intimidating this young woman could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes later, inside the sleek office of Bob&#39;s Cuisine, the paparazzo stood before Bob and relayed the story word for word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s all she said. She told you to quit the games. If you have that much free time, you should start getting ready to close your place early.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob&#39;s anger boiled over. &#34;That woman has no idea how out of her depth she is! I&#39;ve kept this restaurant running for five years. She just arrived -does she really believe she&#39;s a match for me?So full of herself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stuck out his hand. &#34;Hand over today&#39;s footage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cash changed hands as the paparazzo surrendered the video. Before slipping away, he added, &#34;Honestly, sir, I think I&#39;m done. That lady is kind of terrifying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob brushed him off with a wave. &#34;That&#39;s fine.They&#39;re opening soon anyway-we don&#39;t need you around!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, the chef was always the heart of a restaurant, and he had already gotten what he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew Arabella&#39;s kitchen staff was impressive,but he refused to see it as enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His own restaurant boasted Michelin three-star chefs!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where he stood, Arabella had already lost the battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confidence surged through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then his eyes fell on something in the secretly recorded footage-a figure he recognized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that Asher?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He told himself it couldn&#39;t be true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob zoomed in. Although the man&#39;s face was not fully visible, his presence was unmistakable.Unease crept in. Bob hurried through more of the footage, noticing that same man appeared in nearly every clip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A split second later, Bob zeroed in on the cufflinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was definitely Asher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization made a cold sweat break out across his skin, quickly giving way to fresh anger.He slammed his fist down on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Arabella had gotten close to Asher?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that the real reason Asher wouldn&#39;t commit to Rosie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella was unbelievable! How could she stoop so low?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob wasted no time. He grabbed his phone and called Rosie. &#34;You will not believe what I just</p>
                
                
                
                <p>uncovered!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sending the paparazzo on his way, Arabella returned home with Asher. Daisy paced the living room, looking visibly nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella went to her side and took her hand.&#34;Daisy, what&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Daisy answered,&#34;Grandma just called. She wants us to visit her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right away, Arabella knew what that meant. Any call from Vanessa rarely brought anything good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Arabella&#39;s parents died, Vanessa had never shown an ounce of care for them, acting as if they were total strangers. Now that Arabella knew her father was adopted, it mnade more sense to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy turned to Arabella, uncertain. &#34;Do you think we should go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella kept her voice gentle. &#34;What do you want to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy hesitated, biting her lip. &#34;Even if we refuse,if Grandma wants to find us, she&#39;ll track us down sooner or later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s true. Besides, I actually want to see what she&#39;s plotting this time,&#34; Arabella replied, her tone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>turning cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher chimed in, &#34;Let me drive you both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy gave him a look, realizing how he had been driving Arabella everywhere lately, and she felt a touch of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Stanley family&#39;s estate sat on the edge of the city. They spent an hour on the road before pulling up to the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Vanessa and Meagan&#39;s family were already having dinner, and the mood at the table looked almost cheerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Arabella and Daisy entered, Elissa&#39;s eyes flickered with malice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vanessa saw them, but she pretended not to notice and went on eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella led Daisy straight over, sat herself in Vanessa&#39;s chair, and began brewing coffee without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all it took for Vanessa to break her composure. &#34;Arabella, Daisy, it&#39;s been years,and now you just waltz in and start making coffee without saying hello? Have you forgotten your manners?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cold look, Arabella retorted, &#34;So you do remember it&#39;s been years. For a while, I thought S you&#39;d wiped us from your memory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of discomfort crossed Vanessa&#39;s face,but she pressed on, softening her tone. &#34;Don&#39;t be silly. I needed some time for myself, that&#39;s all.Now that I&#39;m back, I called for you the first chance I got. Come on, join us for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella eyed the leftovers piled on the table.Vanessa sure was bold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a polite, insincere smile. &#34;No, thank you.Dad always said it&#39;s rude to join a meal that&#39;s already started.&#34;</p>
