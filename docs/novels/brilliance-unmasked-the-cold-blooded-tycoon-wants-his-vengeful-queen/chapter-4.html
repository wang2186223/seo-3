                <p>Arabella took a slow breath, wiped the tears from her cheeks, and her eyes turned cold, like a fire had been snuffed out and replaced with ice. Her fingers gripped her phone tightly/as she made a call. &#34;That major project-it hasn&#39;t been handed over to the Tucker Group yet, right?Cancel it. Completely.&#34; Her voice was calm but firm. &#34;And get to the Griridge Hospital. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Joshua sounded startled.&#34;Arabella? What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll see when you get here. Bring a few things with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True to form, Joshua didn&#39;t waste time. Less than half an hour later, he rushed into the hospital, and the moment his eyes landed on the girl in the hospital bed, he froze like a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>statue. She looked so much like Arabella-same face,but all color drained, bruised, battered, her body wrecked like it had been thrown away and forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua&#39;s fists clenched. &#34;Who did this? Tell me who it was. I&#39;ll make them pay, I swear it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the sisterof a preeminent figure...and they treated her like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;I&#39;ll handle it myself.Slowly,&#34; she muttered, picking up a pair of scissors from the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Joshua could react, the scissors had already cut through her long, silky hair. The strands dropped to the floor in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared, stunned. &#34;Arabella... you&#39;re not actually...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am,&#34; she said. &#34;This revenge is mine to carry out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua swallowe d  hard, goosebumps rising on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she said it-it was clear. Hell was coming for someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella glanced at him. &#34;Also, what do you know about the Gordons?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Gordon family?&#34; He immediately straightened. &#34;They&#39;re legendary. Way beyond the top elite families. Super wealthy, but incredibly discreet. I&#39;ve only ever worked with the right-hand man of their current CEO.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean Dominick Powell?&#34; Arabella asked casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;Wait, you know Dominick? Don&#39;t tell me... are you saying the Gordons were involved in what happened to Daisy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave him a blank stare before calmly explaining Asher&#39;s connection and what he had said earlier. Joshua slapped his thigh, clearly overwhelmed. &#34;Asher Gordon? If it&#39;s really him,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>then yeah, no one&#39;s faking that. He leads the family. Rumor has it he&#39;s ex-special forces, quiet as a ghost, but deadly. If someone crosses him,they don&#39;t get a second chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella didn&#39;t react. She just stared at the floor, her thoughts turning in circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she spoke, steady and cold. &#34;You should head out now. Also... sell my villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua hesitated. &#34;That place... that&#39;s your parents&#39; home. Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella looked over at Daisy&#39;s fragile frame.&#34;She was tortured in that house. There&#39;s no comfort left there. Just get rid of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice cracked slightly. &#34;And if possible, find a buyer who&#39;s impossible to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua gave her a long look, then nodded.&#34;Understood. I&#39;ve got a bunch of properties lined up. If you ever need a place, it&#39;s yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t look up, and Joshua, sensing she needed space, quietly slipped out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone, Arabella gently held Daisy&#39;s hand and murmured, &#34;I swear, everyone who hurt you...I&#39;ll make them pay for it tenfold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night felt endless, and sleep didn&#39;t come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Arabella stood quietly outside a dance studio at Griridge University&#39;s dance department, listening through the open door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elissa, things have been so dull without that pathetic girl around,&#34; someone inside snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| know, right? No one to fetch us coffee, no one to mess with. It&#39;s no fun without a punching bag,&#34; another chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peering through the glass window, Arabella spotted Elissa in the middle of the dance studio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, Elissa had been just a pale, skinny kid. Now she was dressed in a flowing white</p>
                
                
                
                <p>dance outfit, all elegance and grace, like something out of a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounded by classmates, Elissa flashed a gentle, modest smile at the comments. &#34;Guys,don&#39;t say that. Let&#39;s not be mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re too kind, Elissa,&#34; Joyce Lambert, her good friend, scoffed. &#34;That girl sponged off your family for years. If it were me, l&#39;d have thrown her out of your house on day one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella narrowed her eyes slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calling it their house? Seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That place belonged to her and Daisy. Elissa and her family were the ones living off of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa tilted her head, her voice syrupy sweet.&#34;She&#39;s my cousin, after all. Her parents passed away. If we didn&#39;t take her in, she would&#39;ve had nowhere to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fake compassion earned gasps of admiration from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a generous soul, they all seemed to think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The loud chatter in the dance studio instantly stopped the moment Arabella walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daisy?&#34; Joyce blinked in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at Arabella, stunned. She looked the same, but... something about her felt different now.</p>
