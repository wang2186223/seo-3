                <p>Gordon family?! Elissa&#39;s eyes expanded with pure terror. &#34;Is it that Gordon family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That legendary family-so deeply entrenched in wealth and legacy they practically had their name etched into old money itself-was now targeting her family? And all of this... over Arabella?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa turned slowly to Arabella, her eyes brimming with disbelief and fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you forgotten the Gordons hold substantial shares in Griridge University? Your actions have dragged the university&#39;s reputation through absolute filth-they won&#39;t tolerate this disgrace!&#34; Bennie declared with stern authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Elissa experience a fragment of relief, but the prospect of publicly apologizing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>caused tears to flood her eyes. Several seconds passed before she bowed her head and whispered, &#34;I&#39;m sorry for disappointing everyone. I did terrorize Daisy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before any projectile could strike her, Elissa couldn&#39;t suppress her instincts and bolted from the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennie cast a conflicted glance toward Arabella,then departed as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie and the others hadn&#39;t anticipated the situation spiraling to this devastating point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witnessing the crowd seething with resentment toward Elissa and her group, they quietly prepared their escape when a clear,commanding voice sliced through the air. &#34;Do you believe this is finished?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie met Arabella&#39;s piercing gaze and shivered violently. &#34;We... we are innocent. We</p>
                
                
                
                <p>never realized Elissa was fabricating everything...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, we&#39;re sorry, but we genuinely didn&#39;t intend for this to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly as she released a quiet laugh, yet it carried a powerful sense of menace. &#34;In bullying cases, every bystander becomes an accomplice! And you-you were active participants. You&#39;re even more reprehensible than accomplices! Do you honestly believe a casual claim of ignorance can erase the devastation you inflicted on the victim?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s words resonated deeply with everyone present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s absolutely right. You&#39;re not innocent whatsoever! Didn&#39;t you just want to curry favor with the bullies?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sacrificing others for your own advancement-you&#39;re more despicable than the bullies themselves!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are these people anyway? Does Griridge University still want shameless students like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We, uh...&#34; The group found themselves speechless, unable to raise their heads under the relentless scolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, their phones erupted with notifications. Kenzie was first to examine hers.Griridge University had just posted on Twitter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In light of the recent campus bullying incident,we extend our sincerest apologies. Due to our failure in supervision, those responsible were allowed to go unchecked. The faculty members involved have been dismissed, and all implicated students-led by Kenzie-will be expelled. We are taking a zero-tolerance stance</p>
                
                
                
                <p>moving forward to ensure student safety. Thank you for holding us accountable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie stared at the screen as if it had personally betrayed her. Her hands went limp.Her knees gave way. She dropped to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her whole world came crashing down in a heartbeat.She came from nothing. Getting into Griridge University had been her one-way ticket out of mediocrity. Her family had started treating her differently, and for once, she had felt she was going places.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, it was over. Expelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t fathom how those around her would mock her relentlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie was utterly shattered, and the surrounding students appeared equally devastated. Regret was etched across their faces like permanent scars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella stepped onto the stage, her voice ringing clear and resonant. &#34;Thank you all for attending today, and I hope bullying will never again poison our schools!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The live stream exploded with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| used to witness people getting bullied, and l wanted to rescue them but was too terrified to intervene. From this moment forward, I will champion every victim!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let all the bullies vanish from this world!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Agreed! Here&#39;s to a world free from school bullying!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella took one final look at the live stream,terminated it, and after bidding farewell to everyone,exited the conference hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waited in the parking lot for Asher and Daisy when her phone erupted. It was Joshua.&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I failed to complete the task you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>assigned me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;What happened?But representatives from both the Hyde and the Tucker families still appeared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the time I made a move, both companies were in complete chaos. I heard the Gordons were moving to acquire them. I figured if the Gordon family was already involved, there was no purpose in us taking further action.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella understood, experiencing a complicated surge of emotions. Asher had been exceptionally generous to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand.&#34; Arabella ended the call, lost in contemplation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon Daisy approached and embraced Arabella tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you so much, Bella.&#34; Daisy&#39;s soft voice carried the tremor of suppressed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my failure for not protecting you.&#34;Arabella&#39;s eyes softened as she patted her back gently. &#34;No one will ever harm you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks...&#34; Daisy lifted her head, her eyes red-rimmed but her spirit blazing with exceptional brightness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella glanced at Asher. &#34;Let&#39;s return home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Asher retrieved his car keys and settled into the vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the journey home, Daisy chatted endlessly with Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve already memorized your dance routine,&#34;Arabella said, glancing at her. &#34;Now that this nightmare is over, you can finally go back to practicing with the troupe tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll give it my all!&#34; Daisy grinned, pumping her fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella chuckled.&#34;Good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once home, Daisywent to rehearsewhile -Arabella pulled Asher aside. &#34;I need to talk to you,&#34; she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher looked at her, calm as ever. His deep,penetrating eyes were unreadable-still and cold,like a lake right before a storm.</p>
