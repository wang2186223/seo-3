                <p>Arabella&#39;s expression finally softened. Asher remained beside the bed until her fingers gradually released their grip on his, and only then did he rise quietly and slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Arabella awakened to find herself tucked beneath her own covers.Confusion flickered across her face. She distinctly remembered drifting off in the car,which meant Asher must have carried her inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her usual vigilance had completely abandoned her-she hadn&#39;t stirred once while being lifted and brought upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of self-reproach washed over her,though relief followed close behind. At least it had been Asher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following her morning routine,she checked on Daisy before heading downstairs for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their meal, Asher drove her toward</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Griridge University. This time, however,he stepped out of the car and walked alongside her toward the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can manage on my own,&#34; Arabella said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s gaze remained steady. &#34;I&#39;m attending the anniversary celebration today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat crept up Arabella&#39;s neck as she averted her eyes, suddenly fascinated by the sidewalk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The anniversary celebration had transformed the campus into a bustling carnival. Students and returning alumni filled every pathway,their voices creating a symphony of excitement that even the typically reserved Arabella couldn&#39;t entirely resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spotted a finance lecture on the schedule and decided to investigate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she settled into her seat, Joshua&#39;s familiar figure commanded the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s brow furrowed while Joshua&#39;s face lit up with obvious delight. He sent her a conspiratorial wink that made the girls surrounding her gasp behind their hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Mr. Willis just look at me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dream on-he was definitely looking my way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella buried her face in her palms,mortified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following Joshua&#39;s presentation, another financial expert,Colton Russell, took the podium to discuss market volatility. Arabella, whose passion for finance burned brighter than most realized,absorbed every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the session concluded, a pressing question lingered in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Colton departed swiftly, and by the time Arabella navigated through the dispersing crowd,he had nearly reached the exclusive faculty lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Russell,&#34; she called out breathlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton pivoted, his expression politely curious.&#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to ask you something,&#34; Arabella said,catching her breath. &#34;The concept you discussed at the end-I believe there might be some flaws in the reasoning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Arabella articulated her concerns, Colton&#39;s polite attention transformed into genuine amazement. &#34;What year are you in the finance program?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella shook her head. &#34;Actually, I&#39;m majoring in dance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dance?&#34; Colton blinked, certain he&#39;d misheard.&#34;Please, come inside-I&#39;d love to hear more about your perspective.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the lounge, their conversation flowed with unexpected energy and depth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With such an impressive understanding of financial theory, why choose dance?&#34; Colton asked,leaning forward with genuine curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella pressed her lips together. &#34;There are some personal circumstances involved...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just about to grab lunch. Would you care to join me?&#34; Colton offered warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella considered for a moment,then nodded.Her afternoon stretched empty anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open, and Colton&#39;s face brightened at the newcomer.&#34;Perfect timing-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>how did your session go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well enough.&#34; Asher&#39;s eyes sharpened as they settled on Arabella. &#34;And this is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>remarkably insightful student,&#34; Colton explained. &#34;She challenged some complex financial concepts with real sophistication. I&#39;ve invited her to lunch with us. I don&#39;t believe l caught your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name is, well...&#34; Arabella faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s voice cut through her hesitation. &#34;We should head to lunch now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton, easily distracted, let the matter drop and continued his animated discussion with Arabella as they walked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made their way to a private dining room on the cafeteria&#39;s top floor, though their passage still drew considerable attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s Mr. Russell. Who&#39;s that girl beside him?&#34;Joyce observed sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;I think that&#39;s Daisy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face contorted with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Impossiblel What makes her so special?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s features reflected a storm of conflicting emotions. &#34;I&#39;m afraid it really is her,&#34; she said slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That troublemaker! Now she&#39;s setting her sights on Mr. Russell! What a shameless opportunist!&#34; Joyce hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, several other girls felt their hearts sink like stones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Daisy actually having lunch with Mr. Russell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe they&#39;re just discussing academics.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What could a dance major possibly contribute to a conversation with Mr. Russell?&#34; someone added with barely concealed jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton,with his striking features and reputation as a brilliant young entrepreneur, occupied the same pedestal as Joshua in many female students&#39; fantasies. His lecture had drawn an audience heavy with admirers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of Arabella effortlessly capturing Colton&#39;s attention ignited a wildfire of envy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaitlyn caught a glimpse of Colton&#39;s retreating</p>
                
                
                
                <p>figure,and her expression shifted dramatically Something troubled flickered across her features,leaving her visibly shaken.</p>
