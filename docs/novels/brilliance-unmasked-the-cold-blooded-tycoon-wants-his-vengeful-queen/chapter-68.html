                <p>Them Both!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce whirled around to find Arabella was the one keeping her from storming into Elissa&#39;s hospital room. &#34;Release me this instant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly do you believe you&#39;ll achieve by storming in there at this moment?&#34; Arabella&#39;s voice carried a sharp edge. &#34;Kenny&#39;s heart has already chosen Elissa. March in there now, and you&#39;ll only invite your own humiliation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I refuse to let them escape unpunished! I&#39;ll destroy them both!&#34; Joyce&#39;s voice cracked with fury as she struggled against Arabella&#39;s grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you honestly believe you possess the power to succeed?&#34; Arabella&#39;s stare pierced through her. &#34;You understand Elissa&#39;s nature perfectly welL. She possesses an extraordinary talent for distorting reality to serve her purposes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words struck their target, and Joyce&#39;s struggles ceased. Arabella had spoken an uncomfortable truth-Elissa excelled at</p>
                
                
                
                <p>manipulation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears began forming in Joyce&#39;s eyes. &#34;Then what alternative do I have? Should I simply stand here and watch them betray everything we shared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I possess a method to ensure they pay a far steeper price.&#34; Arabella&#39;s tone remained unnaturally calm, as if she was discussing the weather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s expression hardened, suspicion creeping into her voice. &#34;Why would I place my trust in you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because we now share the same enemy.&#34;Arabella loosened her grip slightly. &#34;Naturally,you could charge through those doors and create a scene, but consider Elissa&#39;s response.She&#39;ll paint you as the betrayer, and Kenny will support her version. You&#39;ll face suspension,perhaps expulsion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rage burning within Joyce began to cool as she recognized the truth in Arabella&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despair crashed over her like a wave, and tears spilled down her cheeks. &#34;What power do you claim to possess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can ensure they spend every remaining day of their lives beneath the weight of universal judgment.&#34; Each word fell from Arabella&#39;s lips with deliberate precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce studied Arabella&#39;s face, her tears gradually stopping as her expression transformed into something cold and resolute.&#34;Very well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes passed before they reached a nearby cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes fixed warily on the masked figure seated beside Arabella. &#34;Who is this person?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy removed her mask and met Joyce&#39;s gaze with quiet composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite their nearly identical features, Joyce recognized Daisyimmediately.	Their personalities created an unmistakable contrast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella commanded attention with her presence,her expression typically frozen in cold detachment, rarely betraying inner thoughts.Daisy appeared softer, though her eyes harbored unmistakable resentment toward Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uncomfortable sensation stirred within Joyce,but she pressed forward. &#34;Daisy, don&#39;t hold my past treatment against me. If you hadn&#39;t attempted to seduce my boyfriend-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you still remain ignorant about the true identity of your boyfriend&#39;s thief?&#34; Arabella&#39;s interruption sliced through the air like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s words died in her throat, and she found herself unable to meet Daisy&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s address the matter directly.&#34; Arabella&#39;s voice carried an arctic chill. &#34;You and your friends crippled Daisy by pushing her down those stairs. I need to know exactly who delivered the fatal push.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Arabella had conducted thorough investigations, the stairwell had lacked security cameras, leaving the truth shrouded in mystery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was the one who pushed her.&#34; Joyce bit her lip, conflict warring across her features. &#34;I believed she was tormenting Elissa,so l...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under Arabella&#39;s penetrating stare, Joyce could barely maintain eye contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your father received my message, didn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s question came without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s head snapped up in surprise. &#34;That message came from you? How did you obtain my father&#39;s phone number?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mother remains in the hospital, doesn&#39;t she? She hasn&#39;t regained consciousness yet.&#34;Arabella&#39;s tone suggested deeper knowledge than she revealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock registered across Joyce&#39;s face,followed by a flash of anger. &#34;Did you orchestrate that attack? But... how could you possibly possess such power?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you assume those men in black acted independently? They answer to me as well.&#34;Arabella lifted her coffee cup with elegant composure.Her casual revelation sent tremors through Joyce&#39;s composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Fear crept into Joyce&#39;s eyes. &#34;WVho are you really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Arabella, Daisy&#39;s elder sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not what I meant, and you know it! Just tell me the truth-who&#39;s your wealthy patron?&#34;Joyce&#39;s gaze turned contemptuous once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elissa fed you that story, didn&#39;t she? She also promised to eliminate me personally?&#34;Arabella&#39;s words struck with surgical precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s body trembled slightly. &#34;Have you been monitoring our conversations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elissa desired my destruction, but observe her current condition.&#34; Arabella&#39;s voice carried quiet satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image of Elissa lying in her hospital bed flashed through Joyce&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Elissa had already attempted to strike?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Joyce studied the elegant, beautiful woman seated across from her, ice seemed to flow through her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I brought you here to offer an opportunity.&#34; Arabella leaned forward and whispered several sentences into Joyce&#39;s ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce listened, and terror seized her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What manner of monster had she messed with?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Joyce departed, her movements carried the unsteady quality of someone walking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>through a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy immediately turned toward Arabella with concern. &#34;Did Elissa actually attempt to harm you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She did, but don&#39;t let worry consume you.As you can see,I emerged completely unscathed,&#34;Arabella&#39;s response carried gentle reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daisy&#39;s expression darkened with anger.&#34;Shouldn&#39;t you have shared this information with me immediately? Do you truly consider me so unworthy of your trust?&#34;</p>
