                <p>From her seat, Arabella watched as the speaker,who was also a dance major, walked straight over to Jessica Roman, the troupe&#39;s instructor,handing her a phone with the video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of thunder crossed Jessica&#39;s face once she finished watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elissa, can you explain what&#39;s going on here?&#34;Jessica asked sharply as she pressed play and showed the video right in front of Elissa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around her, teammates craned their necks to get a glimpse, each one taken aback by what they saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never realized Isabella had choreographed something like that before!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest, it felt recognizable right away. I just never imagined it would turn out to be one of Isabella&#39;s pieces.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has Elissa completely lost it? Plagiarizing Isabella&#39;s dance is asking for trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking credit for a peer&#39;s routine was already a scandal. To steal from Isabella, who had such a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>loyal fanbase, only made it worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word traveled quickly. Audience members shared the clip, and the atmosphere turned from confusion to outrage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t belong in the Griridge Troupe with this kind of behavior!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could the troupe let this happen? Elissa should be kicked out, plain and simpole!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elissa needs to go,right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa felt the world spinning as she stumbled backward, her face completely drained of color.Zoe turned to her, stunned. &#34;Elissa, is any of this true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unprepared and overwhelmed, Elissa stammered,&#34;|...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of realization hit her. Kenzie hadactually taken Isabella&#39;s choreography.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that fact had been clear from the start,admitting to using Kenzie&#39;s routine would have been the least of her worries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the chance to change things had already slipped away, and now everyone was convinced that she had copied Isabella&#39;s work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable!&#34; Zoe&#39;s hand struck without warning, the sharp sound echoing as it landed across Elissa&#39;s cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single blow shattered any dignity Elissa had left. One hand pressed to her stinging face, she tried to speak. &#34;Ms. Miller, I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no idea what you&#39;ve done!&#34; Zoe&#39;s fury was barely contained. This scandal would follow her too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears finally overtook Elissa. &#34;I never wanted things to turn out like this. I only wanted to use her dance for inspiration-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you even know where the line is?&#34; Zoe&#39;s voice rose above the murmurs. &#34;Inspiration isn&#39;t the same as stealing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping forward, Jessica faced the audience.&#34;We sincerely apologize for what happened here.Should it be proven that Elissa copied Isabella&#39;s choreography, she will be expelled from our troupe. Thank you all for demanding honesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp gesture signaled the team to head backstage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold eyes bore into Elissa as Jessica paused. &#34;Is there anything else you want to say for yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made a mistake. I just wanted to study it.&#34; Elissa sobbed as tears rolled down her cheeks and reached her trembling lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are expelled,&#34; Jessica announced in a voice as cold as ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing Elissa another glance, she walked away in search of the vice president for the troupe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A replacement had to be found before the official performance could go on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s legs buckled beneath her, sending her crashing to the floor, the harsh reality settling in that her dream of a dance career had come to an end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time slipped away unnoticed while Elissa sat in stunned silence. As the room slowly emptied,clarity returned, and her only hope now was to plead with Jessica for another chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the rehearsal space, a familiarsilhouette beside Jessica caught her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock made Elissa&#39;s voice crack. &#34;Daisy? Is that really you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella answered with a calm smile, &#34;Hi, Elissa.I&#39;ll be stepping in as your replacement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of disbelief sent Elissa into a panic. &#34;You&#39;re joking! You think you&#39;ve earned this spot?&#34; In her eyes, Daisy was nothing but a background extra,and she could not believe someone like her could ever measure up. &#34;Ms. Roman, she&#39;s not qualified. She just isn&#39;t good enough!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jessica&#39;s patience snapped. &#34;Leave the studio,Elissa.I won&#39;t allow you to disturb our work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation made Elissa raise her voice. &#34;You can&#39;t let her do this! She really can&#39;t do it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Daisy take her place filled Elissa with unbearable humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jessica&#39;s command was sharp. &#34;Out, now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting down hard on her lower lip, Elissa glared with pure resentment. Even so, she forced herself to walk out, dignity in shreds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a measured breath, Arabella turned to the rest of the troupe and offered a polite introduction, her gaze settling on Lailah. &#34;Hi everyone, I&#39;m Daisy Stanley. From today on, I&#39;ll be joining your practices. I might&#39;ve been a substitute before, but I promise to give it my all and keep pace with everyone here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah&#39;s eyes narrowed in clear displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout.thenexthour,thetmosphere  a softened as teammates saw that Arabella&#39;s skills easily matched what Elissa had brought to the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time class ended, a crowd gathered around Arabella, eager to hear the story behind her previous defeat to Elissa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scrolling through group chat messages, Arabella saw how Elissa&#39;s plagiarism scandal had gone viral. Whatever reputation Elissa once had was now in ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online,the drama was only escalating.</p>
