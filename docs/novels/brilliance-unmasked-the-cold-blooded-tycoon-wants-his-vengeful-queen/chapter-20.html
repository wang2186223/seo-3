                <p>Again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is wrong with you? You don&#39;t get to disrespect our leader like that!&#34; Arabella snapped,her cheeks blazing with fake anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trace let out a filthy chuckle. &#34;You think Lailah&#39;s a big deal? l&#39;ve lost track of how often she&#39;s warmed my bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s stomach turned. &#34;So that&#39;s how it is,&#34;she muttered. &#34;She slept her way there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that?&#34; Trace murmured, his eyes gleaming with sick desire as he staggered toward Arabella. But she didn&#39;t flinch. With an icy glare,she drove her foot into his gut, sending him slamming into the stairwell door with a loud thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You disgusting creep,&#34; she hissed. &#34;Touch me again, and I swear you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jolt of pain snapped Trace out of his drunken haze, but her words only made him angrier.&#34;You bitch,&#34; he barked. &#34;You think you can talk to me like that? I&#39;m the one footing the bill for your precious troupe!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella didn&#39;t blink. &#34;Then we&#39;re done. Don&#39;t ever come near us again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You... you ungrateful cunt!&#34; Trace shouted,trembling with fury. But with his weight and the liquor clouding his system, all he could do was stay slumped on the floor. Arabella didn&#39;t even glance back as she walked away, calm and composed. Gritting his teeth, Trace scrambled for his phone, punching in a number with shaky fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, a sick grin spread across Trace&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, it was only a matter of time before Arabella crawling back, begging for mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a hand clamped down on his arm and yanked him upright with zero effort. He blinked,disoriented.&#34;Who the hell are you?&#34; he slurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I just catch the name Daisy Stanley?&#34;Dominick asked, flashing him a laid-back smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trace narrowed his eyes. &#34;You know her or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds like she&#39;s the one who kicked your ass,&#34;he replied, half amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered Daisy was still in the hospital, so</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that meant Arabella did the damage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trace scratched his temple, baffled by how casually this stranger had appeared and now walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick had just been out for dinner with some friends. He hadn&#39;t expected this but figured it wouldn&#39;t hurt to give Asher a heads-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then again, he doubted if his boss would even care enough to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given that Trace looked pathetic and didn&#39;t harm Arabella, he doubted Asher would bother to avenge her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Asher was only watching over Arabella because his father told him to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick shrugged, tossed his phone back on the table, and dug into his food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as he took another bite, the phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the private dining room, the atmosphere crackled with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah leaned back with a smug grin, fully convinced that Trace had already had his way with Arabella and probably had some photos to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>back it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of wiping out that annoying thorn in her side lifted her mood instantly. But then,Jeffrey Barlow&#39;s phone rang. The agent&#39;s expression shifted as he listened, his face slowly losing all color. &#34;Wait... what? Are you serious?How did that even happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole room froze. All eyes locked on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffrey wasn&#39;t one to lose his cool. If he looked rattled, it had to be huge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ended the call with a death grip on his phone.&#34;Our funding just got pulled. Mr. Burke&#39;s done.He&#39;s not investing another dime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mood flipped. Every face in the room turned pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is going on? Wasn&#39;t he always backing us? He&#39;s invested so many times!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We do so much charity work. We&#39;ve got a clean name. Are we supposed to charge now and throw that all away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Lailah looked shaken. &#34;Hang on-wasn&#39;t Daisy the last one with him?&#34; she blurted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as if on cue, Arabella walked back in like nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah&#39;s eyes narrowed to slits. &#34;Daisy, what the hell did you do? Mr. Burke just bailed on us! I told you he was our main backer-are you trying to ruin everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeffrey looked furious as he snapped at Arabella.&#34;You&#39;re part of this troupe,yet you act like some reckless outsider!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah turned stone cold. &#34;If you&#39;re this ungrateful,then leave. We don&#39;t need chaos dressed in sequins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa sighed and shook her head. &#34;Daisy...you&#39;ve really gone too far. Just go before this turns uglier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room split-many glared at Arabella, but a few knew deep down that Trace was the real problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie mumbled quietly, &#34;It doesn&#39;t make sense. If Mr. Burke really wanted to support us, why&#39;d he pull out so fast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah overheard and fired back sharply, &#34;You backup dancers really don&#39;t get how this troupe works, do you? We&#39;re the ones grinding every day for that funding. Who do you think covers your paycheck and pays for those fancy outfits?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you fill-ins care just once?&#34; another dancer</p>
                
                
                
                <p>snapped,rolling her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension thickened across the room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>phone buzzed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered, and his face changed completely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vanguard Group? Are you serious?&#34;</p>
