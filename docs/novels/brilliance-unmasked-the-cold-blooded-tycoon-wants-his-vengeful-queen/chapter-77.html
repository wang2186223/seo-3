                <p>Elissa felt the world tilt beneath her feet. Never once had she imagined Joyce capable of leaking the video. Her certainty had always pointed toward Arabella. She was convinced the girl had orchestrated some elaborate scheme to obtain it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s words only cemented the crowd&#39;s belief that Elissa had been responsible for Daisy&#39;s fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their insults grew sharper, more venomous with each passing moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A barrage of objects flew through the air, aimed at Elissa, Joyce and Kenny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go straight to hell, Elissa!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shameless creature! Absolutely vile!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So because she danced better than you, you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>decided to cripple her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa twisted and ducked frantically, but a jagged stone found its mark, striking her forehead and sending tears streaming down her cheeks from the searing pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Joyce shot to her feet and bellowed, &#34;Silence, all of you! We had perfectly valid reasons for targeting Daisy! She&#39;s the type of girl who throws herself at someone else&#39;s boyfriend!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s gaze found Joyce, and a wave of relief washed over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When circumstances demanded it, Joyce always proved herself the perfect instrument in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Joyce raised the specter of Daisy attempting to seduce Kenny, they could paint their bullying as justified retaliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still trying to frame Daisy with your lies?&#34;Arabella&#39;s voice dripped with contempt. &#34;You</p>
                
                
                
                <p>claim she seduced him-where&#39;s your evidence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce whirled toward Kenny with desperate eyes. &#34;My boyfriend confessed it to me himself that Daisy tried to seduce him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every eye in the crowd shifted to Kenny, who found himself trapped in the spotlight. &#34;That&#39;s exactly right. She did make advances toward me. Probably because I have wealthy parents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You expect us to accept your word as gospel?&#34;Arabella&#39;s laugh cut through the air like ice. &#34;I could just as easily declare that you pursued Daisy relentlessly. We were not born yesterday.Since when does your testimony become absolute law?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny&#39;s expression wavered between confidence and uncertainty. &#34;I can&#39;t produce evidence, but I swear on my honor I&#39;m speaking the truth! If you refuse to believe me, there&#39;s nothing more I can offer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s voice emerged slowly, deliberately.&#34;Daisy had never encountered anyone of Kenny&#39;s caliber before, after all. Her attraction was only natural. Her sole mistake was forgetting he was spoken for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her words faded, her carefully placed supporters erupted in orchestrated support. &#34;I believe every word! Why would Kenny fabricate such a story?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Girls from impoverished backgrounds always fantasize about capturing a wealthy man!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Attempting to steal another woman&#39;s boyfriend -where&#39;s your dignity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa shot Arabella a look brimming with calculated provocation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts churned with satisfaction.&#34;Everything you&#39;ve accomplished today has only dragged Daisy deeper into the mud! You actually believe you wield some kind of power?What a pathetic delusion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, ah... Come on-take me harder, please! I knew it all along, you&#39;re attracted to me, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I am. In my eyes, you&#39;re absolutely stunning! Even if your leg never heals properly,I&#39;d remain by your side forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you saying? My leg will definitely recover completely!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a woman&#39;s passionate moans and a man&#39;s labored breathing echoed from behind them. Elissa&#39;s face drained of all color in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She convinced herself the sounds were mere hallucinations, but when she spun around, she witnessed herself and Kenny captured on video,bodies intertwined on a hospital bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that devastating moment, Elissa&#39;s mind dissolved into complete emptiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny recoiled as if struck, his eyes bulging as he stared at the screen in absolute disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was this possible? How had Arabella managed to obtain this kind of compromising footage?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood frozen in shock, but seconds later,she unleashed a thunderous slap across Elissa&#39;s face before driving her foot into Kenny&#39;s stomach with brutal force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two are absolutely revolting! Elissa, I cherished you as my dearest friend, and you seduced my boyfriend behind my back! Kenny,despite your family&#39;s financial ruin, I remained loyal to our relationship, and you still had the audacity to betray me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the rage Joyce had suppressed for days finally erupted, and she continued her assault relentlessly/. Elissa&#39;s screams pierced the air, her face burning with unbearable agony, shocking her back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Joyce, it&#39;s completely fabricated! This footage has been doctored!&#34; Elissa shrieked desperately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I&#39;m some kind of fool? You don&#39;t believe I can distinguish authentic footage from manipulation?&#34; Joyce&#39;s eyes blazed crimson with fury, her hatred radiating like heat. &#34;I always believed you were gentle and virtuous,but I never suspected how thoroughly corrupted you truly were! You&#39;ve been deceiving me, manipulating me against Daisy,while secretly entangling yourself with my boyfriend! You despicable creature!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce delivered another savage kick, sending Elissa crashing to the floor. Kenny immediately rushed to assist Elissa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight pierced Joyce&#39;s heart. She released a bitter, hollow laugh and declared, &#34;You two truly deserve each other-a manipulative serpent and a fallen heir. You&#39;re perfectly matched!Kenny, we&#39;re finished forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears cascaded down her cheeks as she turned to address the crowd with profound remorse.&#34;I&#39;m deeply sorry, Daisy. All this time, Elissa</p>
                
                
                
                <p>manipulated me completely. I believed you were a shameless temptress, so l attacked you repeatedly. I&#39;m so incredibly sorry!&#34;</p>
