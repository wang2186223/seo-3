                <p>Arabella gave him a gentle look. &#34;You don&#39;t have to worry. I&#39;m really all right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s eyes swept over her, taking in the sight of her drenched hair, soaked clothes sticking to her skin, and the blood spreading across her shoulder. As he saw that she pretended nothing was wrong despite her serious injury, a wave of frustration rose in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke in a clipped voice. &#34;Go get cleaned up first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting Daisy to see her in that condition,Arabella slipped off to the bathroom downstairs to take a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she washed, Asher knocked on the door.&#34;I left your clothes outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she finished, Arabella opened the door and spotted afull set of fresh clothes waiting,even down to new undergarments, which brought color to her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying them on, she realized everything fit perfectly, though the soft pastel shades felt a little too sweet for her taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice reached her from just beyond the door.&#34;Are you finished?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied, &#34;Yes, I&#39;m all done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher entered, carrying a first aid kit in one hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead and slip your arm out of the sleeve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following his instructions, Arabella eased her arm free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher got to work, cleaning the wound with alcohol,every movement smooth and confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole time, his face stayed grim, and it was clear he was far from happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella felt uneasy in the silence and tried to lighten the mood. &#34;How&#39;d you get so good at this kind of thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a clipped tone and no hesitation, Asher said, &#34;I served in the military.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thick silence settled between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing how upset he seemed, Arabella let out a quiet sigh. &#34;It really wasn&#39;t a big deal. I&#39;ve taken care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s response was sharp, his eyes blazing.&#34;You call ths wound a minor problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella decided not to say anything that might upset him. She let Asher bandage her in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression stayed serious, but every touch was careful and gentle. Watching him work,she couldn&#39;t help but smile just a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher caught her look and frowned. &#34;Do you find this amusing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head and let out a soft cough.&#34;No, that&#39;s not it. It&#39;s just-no one&#39;s looked after me like this in ages.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed silent for a moment, then finally spoke, his voice sharp and distant. &#34;People won&#39;t care if you keep acting like you don&#39;t need anyone. Stop carrying the weight alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint shrug escaped Arabella. &#34;I understand.Honestly, it&#39;s not a big deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher didn&#39;t bother arguing. He finished</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wrapping her wound and left the room. After a few minutes, he returned with a steaming cup of lemon water. &#34;You&#39;re soaked through.Drink this or you&#39;ll get sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella noticed the way he watched her, so she finished the whole cup at once. &#34;See? All done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher glanced her way, then turned to go.&#34;Try to get some rest,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as he left, Asher&#39;s posture stayed composed and dignified. Still, Arabella felt a pang of worry. Was he upset with her? And if so,why would he be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing the thought aside, she went back to her room to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, tomorrow was bound to be eventful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By early morning, Arabella was up and ready.Heading downstairs, she spotted Daisy in the courtyard, practicing dance moves,while Asher sat in the living room, reading the newspaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Asher,&#34; Arabella called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher looked her way for a moment and said in a flat tone, &#34;Morning.&#34; Then he returned to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>reading his newspaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella sensed the distance in his voice and felt a little uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As breakfast was set out, Arabella made her way to find Daisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any plans for today?&#34; Arabella asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy replied in a cheerful tone, &#34;Not really.I was just going to practice a bit. What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s lips curled into a sly grin. &#34;Come with me. There&#39;s something I want to show you.l think you&#39;ll find it interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Daisy nodded. &#34;That sounds great!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile lingered on Arabella&#39;s face as she glanced at Asher, who ate in composed silence,every movement naturally refined. After a brief pause, she asked, &#34;Are you busy today, Asher?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look up as he answered, &#34;Yes, I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Asher finished his breakfast and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s brow furrowed. She leaned closer and whispered, &#34;Do you think Mr. Gordon finds us troublesome? I mean, this is still his home.Maybe we should move out soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella found herself wondering the same thing. She could sense the chill in Asher&#39;s behavior and felt uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can talk about it later. For now, let&#39;s get ready to leave after we eat,&#34; Arabella said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When breakfast ended, Arabella took Daisy with her to the hospital. They put on their masks and headed toward a patient&#39;s room, where loud crying and shouts echoed from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s so painful... Am I going to end up crippled?&#34;Elissa cried out from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan&#39;s concern was clear as she spoke up.&#34;What happened to you, Elissa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration and bitterness showed on Elissa&#39;s face. &#34;Someone sent me a message yesterday and asked to meet. But on the way there,I was attacked. They stole everything and beat me up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan asked, &#34;Did they catch anyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking her head, Elissa replied, &#34;No. There aren&#39;t any security cameras in that area.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe broke the silence. &#34;That guy hasn&#39;t reached out again. Doesn&#39;t that mean he finished the job?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this brought Elissa some relief. &#34;Most likely.We did pay for the best assassin around.That little brat won&#39;t be a problem for us anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold glint appeared in Khloe&#39;s eyes as she grinned. &#34;It was expensive, but it was worth every cent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile touched Elissa&#39;s lips, though she kept glancing down at her hurt leg. &#34;I agree,&#34;she said, even if her worry was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe leaned in, hoping to reassure her. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Elissa. You&#39;re in the top hospital in all of Griridge. You&#39;ll recover in no time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa tried to believe it, but her mood was still bleak. &#34;I hope you&#39;re right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy listened to their conversation with a faint frown. Arabella glanced at her, unsure if Daisy realized they were talking about her. Just then,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the elevator doors opened, and Arabella quickly pulled Daisy behind a pillar to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after Kenny stepped inside the room,Meagan and Khloe walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she saw Kenny walk in, a spark of resentment flared in Daisy&#39;s eyes. She whispered, &#34;So Kenny&#39;s here? He and Elissa must be pretty close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella retorted, &#34;It&#39;s more than that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Elissa looked pale as a sheet. Her eyes were hard and bitter, but the moment Kenny appeared, she softened her expression and tried to look helpless and frightened.&#34;Kenny!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry etched across his face, Kenny hurried over. &#34;What happened to you, Elissa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s voice trembled as she wiped her tears and clung to his hands. &#34;It was a trap. I&#39;m terrified,Kenny.&#34;</p>
