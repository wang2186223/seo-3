                <p>Kenny&#39;s gaze drifted past Joyce and settled on Arabella as she approached. Her delicate features drew him in, and without makeup, her natural beauty struck him with unexpected force. For a moment, he found himself completely captivated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce caught the direction of his stare, her expression shifting to storm clouds as she raised her voice sharply.&#34;Kenny!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, baby, you look absolutely radiant today,&#34;Kenny murmured to Joyce, his tone deliberately gentle, his eyes flooding with manufactured affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny possessed the kind of handsome features that commanded attention, carrying himself with practiced refinement. Joyce couldn&#39;t suppress her smile, but then memory crashed back, and she shot a venomous glare at Arabella as she passed. &#34;Daisy, stop right there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the entire class period, Joyce had endured the weight of her classmates&#39; stares-judgmental eyes that seemed to cast her as the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>villain in some unfolding drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Joyce lifted her chin defiantly and crossed her arms. &#34;Stop putting on this pitiful act. Maybe Elissa fabricated some details, but | certainly didn&#39;t invent the part about you throwing yourself at my boyfriend. So quit playing the victim in front of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her accusations left a trail of murmurs rippling through the onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth remained that Elissa had wronged Daisy, but the whispers about Daisy pursuing Kenny had created quite the scandal, and Daisy had never bothered to defend herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If those rumors held any truth, Daisy&#39;s character was undeniably questionable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Conflicted emotions flickered across the classmates&#39; faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella regarded Kenny with cold indifference.&#34;You two make a flawless pair-a jerk and a bitch.Unfortunately, I have no interest in people of Kenny&#39;s caliber.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s faces crumpled simultaneously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce exploded, &#34;How dare you insult me like</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that,you witch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand flew up instinctively to strike Arabella,but Kenny intercepted her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny spoke with calculated softness. &#34;Let it slide, Joyce. She&#39;s just a pathetic creature.Everything happened ages ago. Let&#39;s consider yourselves even now. Besides, my heart beats only for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His honeyed words dissolved most of Joyce&#39;s fury. She wound her arm through his and regarded Arabella with triumphant disdain.&#34;Humph! Daisy, you had the audacity to chase after my boyfriend. What happened before was my way of teaching you a lesson-now we&#39;re square. But if I ever catch you making moves on him again, I won&#39;t show such mercy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that declaration, Joyce swept away with Kenny in tow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The classmates exchanged unreadable glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if Daisy didn&#39;t torment Elissa, seducing someone else&#39;s boyfriend isn&#39;t any more respectable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should probably keep our distance from her.She brings nothing but drama.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaitlyn suddenly laughed. &#34;Honestly, with Daisy&#39;s stunning looks, Kenny doesn&#39;t even deserve to breathe the same air as her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uncomfortable silence descended until someone muttered, &#34;But he has deep pockets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, Joyce&#39;s words had swayed a considerable number of people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaitlyn felt ready to shake sense into her classmates, but Arabella had already pivoted to leave,and Kaitlyn scrambled to catch up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t let them get under your skin. People follow the loudest voice without thinking,&#34; Kaitlyn offered gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re beneath my notice,&#34; Arabella replied with serene composure. She understood human nature&#39;s weaknesses perfectly, and a message had just arrived requiring her attention elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella arrived at the villa where her family used to live, only to discover a mob of protesters gathered outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Return the house to Koko!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shameless woman! Koko&#39;s family showed you nothing but kindness, and you betrayed them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To whoever&#39;s purchasing Arabella&#39;s house, show some decency! That property should never belong to her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They maintained their distance while security guards stood helplessly nearby. The crowd wasn&#39;t causing major disruption, but they were definitely creating a nuisance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Koko served as Khloe&#39;s online persona.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years, Khloe had cultivated a massive following as a social media influencer, and now was precisely the moment to weaponize their loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Khloe sat comfortably in her car,savoring the spectacle with deep satisfaction.The Internet had rallied overwhelmingly to her cause. Could any buyer withstand this kind of public assault? No rational person would want to wade into such a toxic mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The new owner would give up the villa sooner or later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan practically glowed with excitement. &#34;I never imagined we&#39;d be counting on you this time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t fret, Mom. That buyer will surrender the house soon enough,&#34; Khloe replied with a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>delighted giggle. She studied her reflection in the mirror, fingertips grazing her face tenderly. &#34;I can hardly believe this treatment worked so magnificently. Just a few marks remain, and soon they&#39;ll vanish completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was admiring her recovering face when a familiar silhouette caught her eye, and she immediately straightened with interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe pulled on a mask, stepped out of the car,and deliberately positioned herself in Arabella&#39;s path, projecting her voice for maximum effect.&#34;Arabella, what perfect timing. I know you harbor resentment toward me, and the house belonged to you. There&#39;s nothing I can do to change that.I just feel terrible for my mother, after everything she sacrificed for you following your parents&#39;tragic death. Even if you won&#39;t give the house to us, you should at least acknowledge my mother for all she&#39;s done for you.&#34;</p>
