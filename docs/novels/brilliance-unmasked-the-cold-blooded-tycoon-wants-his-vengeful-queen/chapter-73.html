                <p>Elissa froze for a moment, her fingers starting to shake. What was happening? Wasn&#39;t Arabella supposed to be dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny leaned over to glance at her phone, then handed her his own. They had received the same message at the exact same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t think... Arabella&#39;s still alive?&#34; Kenny asked, a cold chilI creeping up his spine, like someone was watching them from the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No chance,&#34; Elissa responded firmly. &#34;Didn&#39;t you see? It was timed perfectly. Someone must&#39;ve scheduled it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really think so?&#34; Kenny muttered under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa seemed sure, until another alert popped</p>
                
                
                
                <p>up on her phone. &#34;Live Broadcast Preview-Confessions of Griridge University Bullies. See you tomorrow at 11AM.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was that supposed to mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart jumped. She opened the stream and saw nothing but a black screen with one line.&#34;DM me if you want the inside scoop tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The viewer count was climbing fast, and the comments were going wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What even is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No clue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Griridge University bullies? Isn&#39;t that the top school around? They have that kind of stuff going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably someone who got bullied made this.I&#39;m on their side!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bullies are the worst. I hope they all get exposed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait... I think I know this story. Didn&#39;t the bully leave the school already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah, can&#39;t say it here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m definitely tuning in tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just saved the stream. I&#39;m ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa could barely breathe. Panic was closing in on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny read the comments, then turned to Elissa with worry. &#34;Are you sure Arabella&#39;s gone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not alive,&#34; she said sharply, regaining her composure. &#34;This has to be Daisy. She&#39;s probably trying to play hero. But it doesn&#39;t matter. As long as we don&#39;t show up, there&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>nothing she can pin on us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kenny wasn&#39;t so sure. &#34;I&#39;ll call Joyce and see if she got the same message.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly called her. Joyce said she got the message too, but her tone was surprisingly relaxed. &#34;You&#39;re awfully relaxed about this,&#34; he said,confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s be honest,&#34; she replied coolly. &#34;We don&#39;t really have a choice. We have to show up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That doesn&#39;t sound like something you&#39;d say,&#34;Kenny replied. &#34;You have something planned,don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce chuckled. &#34;You got me. Look, if we skip it,everything still gets leaked, and we&#39;re finished.But if we show up and apologize, maybe we can fix things, at least a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny narrowed his eyes. &#34;You think that&#39;ll actually work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s voice was more confident now. &#34;We&#39;ll show up and pretend to play along, but then pull out at the last second. There&#39;s no solid proof.We&#39;ll get a few classmates on our side. Let&#39;s be real-who do you think people will believe? Us,or Arabella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea made both of their eyes light up with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa nodded approvingly. &#34;Not bad. So,everything&#39;s set?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave it to me,&#34; Joyce assured her. &#34;You&#39;re still recovering, so I&#39;ll take care of the rest. Kenzie and the others are on our side-they&#39;ll speak up for us when the time comes. Skipping the stream would be the worst idea. At least this way,we can defend ourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re smarter than usual,&#34; Elissa said with a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s smile widened. &#34;We&#39;ve got to be smart about this. If we&#39;re not, even our fathers&#39; firms could get dragged into the mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s smile turned cold. &#34;Let&#39;s see how Daisy handles the backlash. Tomorrow, everything she&#39;s done will come back to bite her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the Gracebourne villa, Arabella was in the kitchen when Daisy walked in with a phone in hand. &#34;Bella, someone from the university is calling.Should I answer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella wiped her hands and took the phone.&#34;I&#39;ll talk to them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered, and the voice on the line quickly said, &#34;Miss Stanley, we saw the live stream preview. We sincerely apologize for what happened-we weren&#39;t aware of your situation.But please understand, this was all Elissa&#39;s personal doing. Griridge University values its reputation, and this is the first time something</p>
                
                
                
                <p>like this has occurred. The online reaction is intense. Would you consider removing the school&#39;s name from the stream?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s tone turned cold. &#34;Even if I remove it,people will stillfind out Elissa was from Griridge.It won&#39;t make a difference.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caller hesitated before adding, &#34;As a gesture of goodwill, we&#39;re prepared to offer $500, 000. Would that be acceptable if you agree to leave the university out of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella didn&#39;t answer right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew the school wasn&#39;t entirely to blame,but they weren&#39;t innocent either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy had been bullied for so long, and no one stepped in, not a single teacher tried to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a deep voice cut through the moment.&#34;Let me take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher had entered the room without them noticing. Arabella handed him the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought it to his ear, his voice cold and unyielding. &#34;Who taught you to brush off responsibility like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause on the other end, followed by a nervous voice. &#34;Mr... Mr. Gordon?&#34;</p>
