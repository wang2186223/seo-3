                <p>Rosie was wearing a long white satin gown that shimmered softly under the light, making her look effortlessly elegant. She exuded the calm confidence and grace of a true lady from a respected family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several guests found themselves sneaking glances at her, captivated by her poised and polished presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting across from Rosie was a younger woman,laughing and chatting with her. But Arabella soon noticed something-Rosie&#39;s smile didn&#39;t quite reach her eyes. Her tone was distant, her posture composed but cold. There was a quiet pride in the way she carried herself, as if keeping everyone at arm&#39;s length.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That subtle aloofness caught Arabella&#39;s eye,making her watch them more closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a waiter passed wvith plates in hand, the younger woman stuck out her foot, clearly trying to trip him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella stepped in quickly. &#34;I&#39;ve got this,&#34; she said, intercepting the waiter and steering him away before anything happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated at being stopped, the young woman quietly pulled her foot back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Arabella could tell-they weren&#39;t done yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the sharp crash of a shattered plate startled the room. The young woman-Raven Russell-suddenly doubled over, gagging dramatically. Rosie leaned forward with a look of concern. &#34;What&#39;s wrong, Raven?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel terrible! The food here is filthy! I&#39;m allergic to anything unhygienic!&#34; Raven cried out dramatically, still gagging as if the very thought made her sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie was furious. &#34;How did this happen? Go get the boss now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A staff member rushed to find Arabella. She arrived quickly, took in the scene with steady eyes, and asked in a composed voice, &#34;Can someone explain what&#39;s happening here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One look at Arabella&#39;s calm, youthful beauty, and Rosie felt a spark of jealousy. So this was the woman Asher cared for? She was younger,sure-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but aside from that, Rosie didn&#39;t see what made her so special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious?&#34; Rosie said coldly. &#34;She ate your food, and now she&#39;s vomiting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That comment stirred unease among the nearby diners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bad hygiene on the very first day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is seriously concerning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I liked the food, but if it&#39;s not clean, that&#39;s a huge problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the murmurs ripple through the room,Rosie knew they were getting exactly the reaction they wanted. She fixed her gaze on Arabella and asked icily, &#34;So what are you going to do about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie figured Arabella was just a spoiled girl riding on Asher&#39;s support, with no real idea how to run a place. Faced with a public mess like this,she must be panicking inside, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprisingly,though, Arabella remained calm. &#34;I&#39;m sorry you feel that way, but our kitchen is kept spotless. You&#39;re more than welcome to check it yourself,&#34; she said politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, turning to the manager, she added, &#34;If any customers want to see the kitchen, take them in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her words, a few curious customers took her up on the offer and went to see the kitchen for themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they came back, they looked genuinely shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, their kitchen&#39;s cleaner than my apartment!&#34; one whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right? There&#39;s no way this place has hygiene issues,&#34; another added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something doesn&#39;t add up here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven shot Arabella a glare. &#34;Maybe you just cleaned everything up before we got there! Ugh! I feel awful. You&#39;ve totally ruined me! I&#39;m never stepping foot in this place again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this how you handle problems? Just make excuses and avoid accountability? Pathetic. If that&#39;s the case, we&#39;re done here, and we won&#39;t be coming back,&#34; Rosie said sharply as she grabbed Raven&#39;s arm to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words held weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few customers looked at each other, and those</p>
                
                
                
                <p>who recognized Rosie whispered, &#34;If Miss Hudson doesn&#39;t like this place, maybe we shouldn&#39;t come again either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,better to be safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella remained calm as she watched them stand up. But just as Raven passed by, Arabella swiftly reached out and grabbed her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Raven snapped, her voice hoarse between exaggerated gags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella released her and said quiety,&#34;Emetics?Clever little setup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven froze for a split second, then composed herself. &#34;I have no clue what you&#39;re accusing me of. This place is a dump and I&#39;m not coming back anyway!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just hope you didn&#39;t sneak that medicine into anyone else&#39;s food,&#34; Arabella said with a faint smile. &#34;How childish of you-taking emetics before showing up, then pretending to get food poisoning. That&#39;s your big plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, her tone light but sharp. &#34;Rosie, it looks like you&#39;re going out of your way to protect your relative Bob&#39;s restaurant. Are you afraid I&#39;ll take his customers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie&#39;s chest tightened. How did she know all that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she had done was lightly touch Raven&#39;s wrist-how could she possibly tell what kind of drug Raven had taken?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had used a vomiting agent and showed up solely to sabotage Arabella&#39;s restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie kept her expression cool. &#34;I don&#39;t know what nonsense you&#39;re spouting. Don&#39;t slander us.And since you won&#39;t own up, there&#39;s no point in staying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie grabbed Raven&#39;s arm and quickly made for the exit, but Arabella&#39;s voice cut through the room-clear and firm. &#34;There&#39;s a hospital right next door. Let&#39;s get both of you checked out. If it turns out you didn&#39;t take emetics, I&#39;ll do whatever you want. But if you did... you apologize to us,publicly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her confidence started shifting public opinion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait a second... did they really come just to stir up trouble? They look elegant, but this is something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, isn&#39;t that one of them Bob Hudson&#39;s cousin? That explains a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh-careful! Do you know who you&#39;re talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie could feel the mood turning against her,and her hands balled into fists. She hadn&#39;t expected Arabella to be this quick-witted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, Arabella was just a naïve girl trying to play in the big leagues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie wasn&#39;t used to being challenged like this,especially not by someone without real influence.In her world, facts could be twisted, and evidence could be erased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how obvious Raven&#39;s little act was, she believed Arabella wouldn&#39;t stand a chance. After all, her family&#39;s power could easily silence the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie raised her chin with quiet confidence,her eyes meeting Arabella&#39;s with a cool, unreadable look. &#34;And why exactly should I care about what you say? Do you really think you&#39;re bold enough to go up against my family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slow, contemptuous smile, she added,&#34;You really make it hard to like you. Let me make this clear-anyone who dines here, your family included, is now blacklisted from doing any business with us.&#34;</p>
