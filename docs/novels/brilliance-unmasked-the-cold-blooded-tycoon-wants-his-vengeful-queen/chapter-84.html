                <p>Daisy didn&#39;t hesitate for a moment. &#34;I&#39;ve made up my mind. Honestly, I like it here. I&#39;m not planning on going anywhere else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella arched an eyebrow, suspicion lingering in her voice. &#34;Are you sure about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linking arms with her friend, Daisy grinned and kept her tone light. &#34;Absolutely! Asher treats us well, and besides, if we leave, he&#39;ll probably miss us. We&#39;d be abandoning him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as she spoke cheerfully, she was calling Asher an asshole silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle wave of relief washed over Arabella,though she couldn&#39;t quite explain why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of Asher&#39;s unreadable stare surfaced in her mind, and for a split second, she believed leaving might actually break his.heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about grabbing a meal at my new place?&#34;Arabella suggested with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delight sparkled in Daisy&#39;s eyes. &#34;You opened a restaurant? No way! That&#39;s so cool. Show me everything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their conversation carried them down the block, but as they turned the corner, Daisy picked up on something odd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The restaurant Arabella owned was practically next door to Bob&#39;s, just one street over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy shot a questioning glance at her companion, but Arabella didn&#39;t bother hiding the truth. &#34;Honestly, I wanted Bob to learn a lesson. At the same time, I figured it would be good for everyone if I just went for it and opened a place here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hung between themn, and Daisy&#39;s heart twisted with gratitude and a tinge of guilt.&#34;You don&#39;t have to go to all this trouble for me.I&#39;m serious, nothing happened with Bob. He</p>
                
                
                
                <p>didn&#39;t have his way with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft hand brushed Daisy&#39;s hair as Arabella met her eyes. &#34;Someone like Bob deserves consequences. If anyone should be the one to deliver them, why not me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to argue any further, Daisy let out a quiet sigh. Arabella spoke with gentle conviction. &#34;This isn&#39;t just about you. It&#39;s something I want for myself. Don&#39;t let it make you feel bad,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little nod was all Daisy could manage. She whispered, &#34;You&#39;re the best. I love you,&#34; before pulling Arabella into a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella wrapped her arms around her, warmth flickering in her eyes. Then, just as quickly, her gaze sharpened. Across the street, through the restaurant window, she spotted Asher sitting by the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated on the other side of the table was a woman dressed in white. Even from afar, there</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was something striking about the way she carried herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella froze, watching closely, while Daisy picked up on the tension. Her anger flared the moment she saw Asher across from the mysterious woman. &#34;I can&#39;t believe him! Asher&#39;s sneaking around with someone else. I&#39;m going in there to give him a piece of my mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intent on confronting Asher, Daisy made a move toward the door but felt Arabella&#39;s hand clamp down on her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Firm and calm, Arabella called out, &#34;Daisy, wait.Let him be. He&#39;s free to date anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy glared, clearly struggling to hold back.&#34;That&#39;s ridiculous! You know how he actually-&#34;She caught herself mid-sentence, her expression clouding as she bit back the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle warning laced Arabella&#39;s voice.&#34;Asher&#39;s done plenty for us, Daisy. There&#39;s no need to start a fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bitterness churned inside Daisy, but she only threw Asher a smoldering look before trailing after Arabella, saying nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell between them as lunch arrived.Arabella kept her eyes down, and Daisy couldn&#39;t help but worry as she watched her sister push food around her plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Arabella checked her phone, her expression unreadable. &#34;I think it&#39;s time we found a new place,&#34; she announced abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words set Daisy on edge. &#34;Did Asher do something to you?&#34; she demanded, already half out of her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking her head, Arabella turned her screen so Daisy could see the headline. &#34;Rosie Hudson and Asher Gordon&#39;s Upcoming Engagement!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The announcement had only been made five minutes earlier, yet it had already climbed to the top of the trending charts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flood of shock hit the table. Daisy&#39;s knuckles</p>
                
                
                
                <p>whitened as she gripped the edge, barely containing her outrage. &#34;How could he go behind your back like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The outburst made Arabella jump. &#34;Daisy, calm down!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears pricked at Daisy&#39;s eyes as she blinked away her anger, her voice trembling. &#34;I just feel like you don&#39;t deserve this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered in Arabella&#39;s gaze. &#34;Why are you so worked up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Searching for an answer, Daisy fell silent.Arabella still had no idea about Asher&#39;s true feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting the subject drop, Arabella straightened her posture and offered a small, steady smile.&#34;Let&#39;s not dwell on it. The food&#39;s getting cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could lift her fork again, her phone buzzed across the table. A new message from Asher popped up on the screen:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His text was casual, almost cheerful. &#34;Is Daisy done with dance for today? Want me to come pick you up later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s jawtightenedassheread the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It amazed her how Asher could cozy up to someone else, then text her as if nothing had changed.</p>
