                <p>Bob stood frozen, struggling to accept what he was seeing.How could any of this be real?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dripped with sarcasm as he sneered,&#34;So that&#39;s it. No wonder neither of you wanted to leave with me. You&#39;ve already found yourselves a sponsor,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curled with contempt. &#34;Guess you figured out how to get what you want by sleeping around-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella cut him off, her tone steady but undeniably threatening. &#34;Sounds like the Johnson family is losing its grip. Maybe that&#39;s why you&#39;re so bitter and running your mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned in just a bit and continued, &#34;And since you seem so familiar with this world, is that how your family does business-by hopping into bed with the right people? Maybe</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ll pass that rumor to the press.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob retorted, &#34;What are you talking about! My family is in the top five in all of Griridge! | don&#39;t need to hustle for deals on my own. If anything,you&#39;re the suspicious one,coming up with all that cash at your age.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella only shrugged. &#34;Enjoy your comfortable life while it lasts. Good fortune doesn&#39;t stick around forev/er.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you think you&#39;re intimidating?&#34; Bob didn&#39;t buy her act, but there was something in that steady, unreadable stare that sent a shiver crawling down his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about this woman set him on edge.She had an energy that made her hard to challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His injured arm began to throb, and though he wanted to keep arguing, the fear of getting hurt even worse kept him in check. With a final glare,he snapped, &#34;You&#39;ll regret this!&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spun around and stormed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kate hurried after him, desperation in her voice.&#34;Mr. Johnson, aren&#39;t you going to buy anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob didn&#39;t give her a single glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy feeling settled in Kate&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Ruth grinning ear to ear only made Kate feel worse. That sale meant a big bonus. It was the biggest commission in the store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed over to Ruth, voice sharp.&#34;That was my customer. The commission should go to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruth stared at her in shock. &#34;How can you even say that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kate explained, her tone sharp, &#34;The girls were supposed to be my customers. You were only filling in for me, so the commission should go to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy looked like she wanted to step in, but</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella stopped her. &#34;Don&#39;t waste your breath.She&#39;s not getting that bonus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking Daisy by the arm, Arabella led her toward the exit while the argument between Kate and Ruth grew louder. Suddenly, Kate&#39;s phone rang.She listened to the voice on the line, then quickly begged, &#34;Please, sir, what did | do wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The response came cold and fast. &#34;You&#39;ve made enough mistakes. Clean out your things and leave. You&#39;re fired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended before she could finish her thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dread settled over her. She had worked hard to land a job at such a fancy boutique. The prestige and pay meant everything to her.Where was she supposed to go now? Who had she upset so badly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Daisy looked up at Arabella, her eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>filled with wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really are rich, Bella,&#34; Daisy said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile crossed Arabella&#39;s face. &#34;Of course. You never have to worry about money again. Buy whatever catches your eye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re incredible.&#34; Daisy squeezed Arabella&#39;s arm, glowing with admiration. Arabella&#39;s smile grew as she guided Daisy toward the jewelry stores.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their next stop was dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella picked a fine restaurant for their meal.As luck would have it, just as they reached the entrance, they spotted Asher chatting with a group of foreigners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke their language with ease, his posture straight and his entire presence radiating sophistication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher gave Arabella a brief glance, then returned to his conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella decided not to interrupt and began heading inside. The foreigners finished up and walked away, so she paused and greeted him,&#34;Hi Asher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello,&#34; Asher replied, his voice cold and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella found herself at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher remarked, &#34;You can use my private dining room for your meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He led them upstairs to a quiet VIP suite. Every corner of the room spoke of refined taste, the space filled with a sense of quiet luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher gestured for them to order whatever they wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Daisy scanned the menu, Asher leaned in to Arabella and said, &#34;Come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Arabella&#39;s surprise, they stepped into a cozy lounge area, complete with a small bed and a comfortable sofa. She settled onto the sofa,and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher instructed, &#34;Lower your shirt from your shoulder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella hesitated. &#34;It&#39;s just a scratch. I can handle it myself when I get home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Asher was already rummaging in a drawer for a medical kit. His tone left no room for argument.&#34;Let me see it. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With little choice, Arabella slipped her shirt off her shoulder, watching as Asher reached for tweezers and disinfectant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tended to her wound with careful hands,fully focused on his task. She couldn&#39;t help but watch him closely-his skin looked flawless, his features sharp and striking, lashes thick and long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the most handsome man she had ever met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Asher&#39;s deep voice caught her off guard. &#34;Are you finished staring?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella, caught in the act, felt a twinge of embarrassment but answered boldly, &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m finished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher let out a quiet sigh, as if he couldn&#39;t believe how direct she was about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella changed the subject. &#34;I wanted to let you know-Daisy&#39;s recovered. Thank you for everything you did for us. We&#39;ll be moving out Soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words had barely left her lips when a sharp sting shot through her arm. She winced, doing her best not to react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher pulled his hand away, his tone even and hard to read. &#34;Why are you moving out?&#34;</p>
