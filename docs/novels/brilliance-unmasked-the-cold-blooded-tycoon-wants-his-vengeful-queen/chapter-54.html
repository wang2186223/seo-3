                <p>Arabella&#39;s answer was immediate, her tone colder than ice. &#34;Don&#39;t even think about it.Asher and I can never be together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second she finished her sentence, Colton left a palpable chill in the air,one that seemed to cling to Asher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton had already been caught off guard several times today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Arabella shut Asher down, Colton couldn&#39;t believe her boldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Asher spun on his heel and strode off. Colton wasted no time, slipping away before he could get dragged into the awkward scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity flickered in Joshua&#39;s eyes, but Arabella offered him no explanation. &#34;You have work to do. Go on,&#34; she told him firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua hesitated,then tried to lighten the mood &#34;Fine, but if you start missing me, just give me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a call,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reluctance was obvious as he turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bother replying to his rambling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, a major event was set to take place in the gym.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of sitting through it held zero appeal for Arabella, and she was heading off campus when Elissa appeared in her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her name called, Arabella stopped. As Elissa drew near, a faint, sweet scent drifted between them. Arabella noticed it right away,thanks to her sharp senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She narrowed her eyes. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a gentle tone, Elissa made her case. &#34;There&#39;s a show at the gym this afternoon. Would you watch it with me? I&#39;ve been thinking about us since yesterday. My family was wrong before. I want to be like we were as kids-close, without all this distance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You act like a fox eyeing the henhouse,&#34;Arabella replied, sarcasm dripping from her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, Elissa&#39;s face twisted, but she quickly replaced it with a look of regret. &#34;Say whatever you want. I&#39;ll accept it. I just want another chance for us to be friends again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella rolled her eyes, but before she could add anything else, a wave of dizziness washed over her. Her hand went to her forehead. When she noticed this, Elissa&#39;s eyes glinted. &#34;Are you all right?&#34; she asked, her voice honey-sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My head is spinning... Why do I feel so strange?&#34;Arabella managed to mumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s odd,&#34; Elissa replied smoothly. &#34;Let me help you sit down for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging Arabella along, Elissa made a beeline for the gym.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every attempt Arabella made to pull free failed -her strength just wasn&#39;t enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they arrived at the equipment room,Elissa&#39;s sweet smile faded. Ice replaced every trace of kindness in her eyes. With a sudden shove,she forced Arabella inside and slammed the door shut, locking it tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Please, someone, help me! Let me out of here!&#34; The voice drifted weakly from inside,its desperation muffled by the thick door that stood in the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A satisfied grin crept across Elissa&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She silently boasted, &#34;Go ahead and challenge me, Arabella. You&#39;ll regret ever crossing me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement buzzed in the air as the performance drew near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A famous guest had packed the house, and every seat pulsed with energy and expectation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce searched the room for Arabella but didn&#39;t spot her anywhere. That made her lips curl into a quiet, knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A girl in the next row spun around to steal a look at her, whispering to a friend. The sight made her mood sour in an instant. She kicked the back of her chair. &#34;If you&#39;ve got something to say about me, let&#39;s hear it. Don&#39;t keep secrets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear drained all color from the girl&#39;s face. She stared at Joyce as though she had seen something out of a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers of worry spread to the students nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching everyone react like that only fueled Joyce&#39;s irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did everyone insist on treating her like a villain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that Kenny was sitting next to her made the embarrassment sting even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well? Care to explain what you&#39;re talking about?&#34; Frustration rising, Joyce kicked the girl&#39;s chair a second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, the girl burst into tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her friend had finally had enough. Embarrassed by the scene, especially with so many eyes on them, she snapped back, &#34;You&#39;re seriously asking? Like you don&#39;t know? Haven&#39;t you made a habit of bullying people?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dirty looks were exchanged across the row as more students glanced over at Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t it just sad, someone her age still acting like a bully in college?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She tried stealing my boyfriend, so of coursel stood up to her,&#34; Joyce snapped,not bothering to hide her annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice rang out from a few seats away-Kaitlyn challenged her. &#34;Can you actually prove that? Remember how Elissaonce claimed Daisy was at her place, but it turned out Elissa had moved into Daisy&#39;s home instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every eye seemed to settle on Joyce, and her hands started to sweat. She raised her voice,desperate to convince everyone. &#34;My boyfriend told me straight out. Isn&#39;t that proof enough?Kenny,back me up here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attention landed squarely on Kenny, who looked uncomfortabole but nodded. &#34;Yeah,that&#39;s what happened,&#34; he admitted, his tone resigned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not buying any of this without real proof,&#34;Kaitlyn said, dismissing the whole thing. &#34;If someone wants to play the pawn, that&#39;s their own business, not mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, she turned away and focused on the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the other students followed suit,returning to their own conversations and whispering behind their hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl Joyce had bullied kept crying, and her friend shot daggers at Joyce, eyes full of blame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Defeat settled over Joyce like a heavy cloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why couldn&#39;t they just see things from her side?One day,the truth would come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments before the show started, the staff hurried over to the equipment room, surprised to find the door locked tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who shut this door? Wasn&#39;t it supposed to stay open?&#34; a staff member asked, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shrugs and head shakes circled the group.&#34;None of us locked it,&#34; someone replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, faint noises seeped from inside-strange,distressed sounds that caught everyone off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Muffled cries echoed behind the door, and realization spread silently across the group.Uneasy looks were exchanged as people understood what was going on.</p>
