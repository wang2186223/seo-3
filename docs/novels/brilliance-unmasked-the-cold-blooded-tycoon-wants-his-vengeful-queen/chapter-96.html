                <p>Arabella&#39;s eyes narrowed sharply. Without wasting a second, she issued a few quick orders and rushed straight toward the dance troupe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over at the Griridge Opera House, the dance studio had erupted into pure chaos. Two groups of dancers were desperately trying to pull Lailah and Daisy apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their hair was messy, their clothes wrinkled,and both had scratches on their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick stormed in after getting the news. He took one look at the scene and barked, &#34;What on earth is going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She hit me first!&#34; Lailah snapped, biting her lip in frustration. &#34;Mr. Stone, she actually laid hands on me! This is unacceptable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy didn&#39;t back down. &#34;That&#39;s because she insulted my family first!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| didn&#39;t insult her family!&#34; Lailah cried in protest.&#34;All I said was that her dancing needed work, and she attacked me!&#34; She looked at Patrick with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>teary eyes, playing the victim. &#34;If Daisy treats me like this, how am I supposed to lead this team?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick faced Daisy with a stern expression.&#34;Lailah has a point.She&#39;s your team leader-how could you hit her? That goes against everything we stand for. You&#39;ve left me no choice. You&#39;re expelled from the troupe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The studio fell into stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy? Expelled-just like that? The news sent a ripple of shock through the studio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie stepped forward, frowning. &#34;Mr. Stone,don&#39;t you think it&#39;s too soon to jump to that decision? You haven&#39;t even heard the full story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lailah&#39;s been here for years.&#34; Patrick addressed Daisy. &#34;No matter what, you don&#39;t lay a hand on your. If she said something offensive, you should&#39;ve brought it to our attention, not lashed out. If everyone started throwing punches whenever they were upset, what would happen to society?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A girl from the substitute team suddenly chimed in, &#34;He&#39;s right. No matter what, violence shouldn&#39;t be tolerated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Sarah Wells, a curly-haired dancer whose</p>
                
                
                
                <p>eyes were practically shining with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daisy got kicked out, there would be a vacancy in the main lineup, and Sarah just happened to be the most likely candidate to move up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could already imagine what it would feel like to be part of the core team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Violence should never be tolerated,&#34;another dancer added, jumping on the bandwagon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daisy&#39;s temper is scary,&#34; someone else murmured. &#34;She makes rehearsals stressful for everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s expression darkened. She turned to Patrick, her voice cold. &#34;If you&#39;re going to stand by Lailah no matter what, Mr. Stone, then there&#39;s nothing more to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick&#39;s face twisted with anger. &#34;Watch your tone, Daisy! That&#39;s no way to speak to your superior!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daisy opened her mouth to reply, a calm and steady voice interrupted. &#34;Apologies, Mr.Stone. Daisy&#39;s always been a little blunt. Looks like she accidentally told the truth out loud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall woman stepped into the room, wearing a hat and a face mask. Even with her face mostly covered, her calm and confident presence stood out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s eyes lit up. &#34;Bella!&#34; she called out with relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie let out a quiet breath, feeling calmer now that Arabella was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella always made her feel safe, evenin messy situations like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be Daisy&#39;s sister,&#34; Patrick said sternly.&#34;If she&#39;s out of line, are you too? Do you even realize what you&#39;re doing? This is defamation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, then added coldly, &#34;I&#39;ll give you one chance to apologize. If not, you&#39;re banned from the troupe-permanently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went quiet as all eyes turned to Daisy and Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same thought crossed everyone&#39;s mind-those two didn&#39;t fear a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m telling the truth,&#34; Arabella calmly replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any proof?&#34; Sarah shouted right away, eager to make herself stand out. She saw</p>
                
                
                
                <p>this as her moment-if she backed Patrick, maybe she would finally be promoted to a full member.Stepping forward, she challenged boldly, &#34;If you&#39;re so confident, then show us the evidence!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then,&#34; Arabella said as she pulled out her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick watched her quietly, and a strange feeling settled in his chest. What if she really did have proof?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a tense pause, Patrick forced a strained voice. &#34;Forget it. You&#39;re still young. I&#39;ll overlook it this once. Just leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a small smile, though her eyes stayed cold. &#34;That&#39;s not your call to make. It&#39;s whether I&#39;m willing to let you off the hook.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down Patrick&#39;s spine,but he raised his voice to mask it. &#34;I&#39;ve clearly been too lenient.If you don&#39;t appreciate kindness, then fine-security! Get them out of here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah rushed forward and grabbed Daisy&#39;s arm.&#34;Didn&#39;t you hear? Mr. Stone said get out!&#34; she barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several other dancers joined Sarah,shoving Daisy toward the door. Karlie stepped in, trying to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>intervene. &#34;Stop! You don&#39;t even know what really happened!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah shot Karlie a frosty glare. What an idiot.Didn&#39;t she realize this was their shot? If Daisy was out, someone finally got promoted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella stepped in front of Daisy and stood tall,blocking the substitute members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her strong presence made them pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, the security guards came in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take these two girls out,&#34; Patrick said, glancing at them once more before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a voice from a video clip played out loud. &#34;You&#39;ve got the skills. You think the main team&#39;s all that? Lailah? She&#39;d be nothing if it weren&#39;t for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is wrong with you? You don&#39;t get to disrespect our leader like that!&#34; someone shouted back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trace sneered. &#34;You think Lailah&#39;s a big deal? I&#39;ve lost track of how often she&#39;s warmed my bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman&#39;s voice in the video had been muted,but the man&#39;s voice came through clearly, and there was no doubt about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Trace.</p>
