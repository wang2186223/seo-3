                <p>The screen flickered as the results materialized with startling clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s voice cut through the silence like a blade. &#34;Campus security footage reveals everything. Immediately after class ended,you dragged Daisy into that stairwell. Minutes later,they carried her out-drenched in blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dear God!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spectator&#39;s hand flew to cover their mouth,horror etching across their features. &#34;That&#39;s absolutely savage!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Revolting! That manipulative witch needs to pay for her crimes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s gaze swept across the screen.She was momentarily stunned by Arabella&#39;s meticulous</p>
                
                
                
                <p>preparation, but she recovered swiftly with a sharp retort. &#34;If you&#39;re determined to destroy my reputation with lies, then I&#39;ll expose what really happened! I confronted Daisy because she tormented me repeatedly-for months!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotion strangled Elissa&#39;s words as tears pooled in her eyes, transforming her into a portrait of wounded innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The students in the audience rose as one, their movement creating a ripple of solidarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie&#39;s voice rang out with conviction. &#34;You have to trust us-Elissa possesses genuine kindness. She&#39;s shown us nothing but compassion. How could anyone believe she&#39;d terrorize a classmate? We witnessed everything firsthand. During class, Daisy relentlessly attacked Elissa. I stood there in that stairwell,watching Daisy tear her down, sneering about how worthless she was, how she&#39;d never measure up...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Precisely! Daisy destroyed Elissa emotionally,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>so if Elissa finally defended herself, justice demanded it. Besides, she never actually harmed Daisy-we simply refused to associate with someone so venomous! Nobody wanted friendship with that kind of poison!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely! Daisy embodies pure malice! She victimized Elissa constantly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The testimony from over a dozen students sent confusion rippling through the crowd like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s declaration boomed across the room.&#34;If I truly terrorized Daisy, I&#39;ll eat my hat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vow silenced the assembled masses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening here? With so many students defending Elissa, I&#39;m completely bewildered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s impossible that all these people participated in bullying Daisy, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what about those photographs from earlier? These three must be scheming something sinister!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those are merely images-we don&#39;t understand the complete circumstances. Like Elissa explained, if Daisy attacked her first, then retaliation seems justified, doesn&#39;t it? Where&#39;s your concrete evidence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella bestowed a subtle smile upon the trio.&#34;So you&#39;re truly committed to this path of stubborn denial?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa regarded Arabella with weary resignation.&#34;| understand your animosity toward me,Arabella, but you cannot assault us with these fabrications. We genuinely didn&#39;t commit the acts you&#39;re describing-we simply didn&#39;t!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny interjected with fervor, &#34;Exactly right.Daisy lacks any redeeming qualities! It&#39;s absurd that a bully can still ridicule.others!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce remained the sole silent figure among</p>
                
                
                
                <p>them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s attention shifted to Joyce, who finally spoke with deliberate slowness. &#34;Bullying Daisy was completely justified! Elissa never touched her-I handled everything. I couldn&#39;t stomach Daisy&#39;s existence. She earned every moment of suffering!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bullies&#39; righteous fury rendered the entire room speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie&#39;s voice pierced the stunned silence once more. &#34;Consider this logically, everyone. If Daisy truly suffered as the victim, would she possess the capability to mobilize so many people against her supposed tormentors?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Truth! Don&#39;t let these people deceive you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone exchanged uncertain glances, their expressions growing increasingly conflicted as they turned toward Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s right. If Daisy was genuinely the victim,how could she have orchestrated this entire</p>
                
                
                
                <p>confrontation and gathered us here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least currently, I believe Daisy and her sister demonstrate considerable cunning. How could someone so calculating be bullied? Ha,I doubt they possess any integrity!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is outrageous. You manipulated us! How dare you expect us to travel this distance and champion your so-called justice?&#34; someone bellowed furiously, hurling a rotting tomato toward Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witnessing this aggression, others began launching projectiles as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s face darkened as she observed the chaos and began rising to her feet, but Asher&#39;s voice emerged cold and low. &#34;Arabella anticipated this reaction. If you intervene now,you&#39;ll only escalate the disaster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s fists clenched untilher knuckles turned white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before any object could·strike Arabella,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>several black-clad bodyguards materialized and formed a protective barrier around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguards&#39; commanding and intimidating presence sent shock waves through the nearby spectators.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bodyguards?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Incredible, they even employed personal protection?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And securing this venue must have cost a fortune. Add the private security, and that&#39;s beyond ordinary people&#39;s reach. Clearly, they orchestrated this entire spectacle to destroy Elissa and her friends. That&#39;s pure evil!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd&#39;s hostility intensified like a gathering storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On stage, Elissa&#39;s lips curved into a satisfied smirk as she surveyed the scene, casting a contemptuous glance at Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what if Arabella had survived? Did she truly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>believe those photographs could secure a conviction? How pathetically naive. What an absolute joke!</p>
