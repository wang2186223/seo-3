                <p>Few names carriedas much weight in the dance world as Isabella&#39;s, making Elissa&#39;s choice of victim the worst mistake she could have made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That routine Elissa put on? Nothing more than average. Trying to use Isabella&#39;s fame to boost herself is just laughable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Griridge Troupe needs to be far more selective about its members!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In school, Elissa is a decent dancer. But let&#39;s be honest, she has a real problem with jealousy.Anyone who outshines her becomes a target.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why hasn&#39;t Griridge University expelled her already? Do they care about their reputation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new notification appeared as Kaitlyn sent a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>message. &#34;Kenzie got beat up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A series of photos followed, revealing Kenzie&#39;s bruised face and a noticeable limp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of this shocked Arabella. She responded,&#34;Thanks. But what&#39;s your reason for sending me this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaitlyn replied almost immediately, &#34;I figured you&#39;d want to know what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing her eyes, Arabella tried to piece together Kaitlyn&#39;s motives. Whatever connected Kaitlyn and Daisy was still a mystery,but Arabella didn&#39;t sense any malice from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving the theater, Arabella barely took two steps before someone&#39;s hand clamped around her arm. &#34;I knew you had something to do with this,Arabella!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes wide with disbelief, Meagan confronted her,suspicion written all over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to her, Elissa&#39;s eyes were puffy and red</p>
                
                
                
                <p>from hours of tears, her carefully built reputation having crumbled in an instant. The moment she caught Arabella&#39;s name and laid eyes on her, bitterness twisted across Elissa&#39;s face. &#34;So, you&#39;re Arabella.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, a sense of dread crept in and made her stomach clench.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella and Daisy could not have been more different when they were little girls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone remembered Daisy&#39;s bright, bubbly spirit, a complete contrast to Arabella&#39;s cold,almost unapproachable presence. That chilling aura always left others uneasy. Only after Arabella left did their bullying of Daisy begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s disappearance came right after grade school,and she claimed to work. They assumed that she might have started a family far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could have guessed she would turn up again like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reminded of Arabella&#39;s rough past, Elissa felt</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her contempt deepen. &#34;You&#39;ve got guts,Arabella. Dropping out after elementary school and faking your way into Griridge University?That&#39;s against the law!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One step closer, Arabella fixed Elissa with an indifferent glare. &#34;The way you and your family treated Daisy is enough to put you away for life.You got away once, but I&#39;m here to make sure you finally pay for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thunderclap split the sky, and the clouds unleashed a sudden downpour, rain hammering the pavement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goosebumps pricked Meagan&#39;s and her daughters&#39; arms as the temperature dropped,and Elissa instinctively edged away. &#34;Y-you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaw clenched, Meagan interjected, &#34;Stop making things up, Arabella. Daisy had this coming, and you know it! Go straight to the troupe and confess. Tell everyone you set up Elissa and that she didn&#39;t plagiarize!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe&#39;s anger flared as well. &#34;That&#39;s right! How dare you accuse Elissa of such things? You&#39;re nothing but trouble!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her hand to strike, fury written all over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Arabella was nothing like Daisy. The cold,defiant look in her eyes made Khloe falter.Images of Arabella&#39;s legendary temper flashed through Khloe&#39;s mind, and fear sent her scurrying behind Meagan for safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a deep breath, Elissa, older and more composed, switched tactics. Her voice turned gentle, almost pleading. &#34;Arabella, let&#39;s not fight about this. We&#39;re family, aren&#39;t we? Let&#39;s go home and work things out together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile crossed her face as she added,&#34;You only made it through elementary school,and you don&#39;t have any kind of certification. Life out there must be pretty rough for someone like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella responded, her words cold and sharp.&#34;If people like you are surviving just fine, then why would you think I&#39;d have a hard time? And I already warned you. Get out of my house,now.I don&#39;t want to see you there any longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting another second, Arabella flagged down a cab and climbed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration boiled over, and Khloe snapped,&#34;That woman is absolutely insufferable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy frown appeared on Elissa&#39;s face. The thought that Arabella posed as Daisy was something she never would have believed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain came down in sheets, forcing them to rush back to their house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at home, irritation lingered in Elissa&#39;s voice. &#34;You could have told me sooner that Arabella was back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe let out a grumble. &#34;Mom said it was better not to bother you since you&#39;re busy with the dance group. Tell me the truth. Did you copy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>someone else&#39;s work because of Arabella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa clenched her fists as she thought about Kenzie, bitterness rising inside her. &#34;It&#39;s got nothing to do with Arabella.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh escaped Khloe. &#34;Well, that&#39;s that.Arabella clearly isn&#39;t all that impressive. Who does she think she is, talking to us like that?The days when her parents mattered are over.Our family holds the most power in Griridge now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, an idea flashed in Khloe&#39;s mind. She gave Elissa&#39;s arm a quick tug. &#34;Go tell your . .. ...</p>
