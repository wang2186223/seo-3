                <p>Joyce looked like she was about to blow a fuse.&#34;Are you all seriously buying into those random online posts? Have you completely forgotten who Elissa is? She&#39;s always had your backs!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The students around her shifted uncomfortably,muttering half-hearted greetings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,Elissa...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning...&#34; The words came out stiff, like they were being dragged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Arabella strolled in, her voice cutting through the tension like a knife. &#34;Starting your day by bullying someone again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got guts showing your face here!&#34;Joyce shouted and tried to slap her. But Arabella moved just in time with a small smile,and Joyce lost her balance and fell to the floor with a loud thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ow, damn it!&#34; Joyce cried, pain shooting through her already sore body from yesterday&#39;s brutal laps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa winced. Joyce always had more bark than bite and never knew when to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes narrowing, Elissa met Arabella&#39;s gaze and muttered, &#34;You&#39;ve really changed, Daisy. Or maybe this is who you were all along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guessed it,&#34; Arabella said with a low laugh.&#34;And this version? She&#39;s your worst nightmare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s eyes flared with irritation, but then a smug smile formed on her lips. &#34;Joyce is the best dancer we&#39;ve got. The Griridge Troupe has had their eyes on her for months. You picked the wrong rival, Daisy. One word from her,and your spotlight dream goes up in smoke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the teacher entered. Her expression was hard to read as she scanned the room. &#34;Daisy, a word outside,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce grinned at Arabella&#39;s retreating back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch, she&#39;s about to get chewed out big time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned to Elissa and whispered, &#34;Hey,what&#39;s going on with Daisy? She&#39;s acting so weird lately. You think she&#39;s, like, possessed or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa rolled her eyes. &#34;She&#39;s not possessed,just pissed off. Even doormats will bite back if you step on them enough. I told you not to push her that hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce snorted. &#34;Let her come at me again. I&#39;ve already got the perfect plan lined up to wreck her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Arabella stood face-to-face with the teacher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Stanley,&#34; the teacher began. &#34;You&#39;ve been selected as a candidate for the Griridge Troupe.Care to explain how that happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s voice was calm and steady. &#34;I earned it.Simple as that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe Miller, her teacher, looked like she had swallowed a lemon. &#34;Have I taught you nothing about humility? You haven&#39;t been practicing at all. And you really think you&#39;re better than Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella didn&#39;t blink. &#34;Not just better. Joyce isn&#39;t even close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s face flushed deep red. &#34;You&#39;re way too arrogant. Just step aside and let Joyce have the spot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella tilted her head. &#34;Why? Because she&#39;s your niece,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe stiffened. For a split second, her mask cracked.How did she know that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she quickly regained composure. &#34;The Troupe only wants the best. You&#39;ll embarrass yourself. Step down now, and I&#39;ll make sure you get a scholarship instead.Sounds fair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s stare sharpened. This Zoe woman had turned a blind eye to everything because</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she was Joyce&#39;s aunt. By letting Joyce bully others, she was just as guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not happening,&#34; Arabella responded flatly, and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the studio, students looked up as she entered. Zoe followed shortly after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was practically vibrating with anticipation.&#34;Miss. Miller, did the results come in yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could already picture it-snagging the spot,then making sure Daisy never got another shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe hesitated. &#34;They did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce leaned in. &#34;So... who made it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s... Daisy,&#34; Zoe said, biting her lip as she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>gave Arabella a pointed look. &#34;Be prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rehearsals at the theater start tomorrow.&#34;</p>
