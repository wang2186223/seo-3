                <p>Khloe&#39;s followers snatched up the scattered papers, their curiosity piqued by the unexpected drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The documents revealed the shocking truth-detailed records of everything Meagan had secretly sold from within the villa&#39;s walls over the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella had witnessed these transactions all along but remained silent, dismissing the stolen items as insignificant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did the math and found that Meagan had quietly liquidated possessions worth millions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gosh, that&#39;s an astronomical amount of money!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Their family must be swimming in wealth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Obviously! This happens to be one of the most prestigious neighborhoods in Griridge... Wait,what&#39;s happening here, Koko? Did your family actually sell that much valuable stuff?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe studied the damning records, desperately</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wanting to mount a defense but finding herself speechless. She clenched her teeth against the rising fury and forced out the words, &#34;That money went toward supporting you and Daisy! Even if you wave those papers around, it won&#39;t change anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you can easily show us the receipts for what you supposedly spent on me and Daisy,right?&#34; Arabella&#39;s smile turned glacial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan&#39;s lips quivered uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella stepped closer, her presence commanding. &#34;Can&#39;t produce them, can you?Because the food at home arrived fresh from the farm every single day, and all the clothes Daisy and I wore came as gifts from luxury brands.Before my parents departed, they ensured we lacked nothing. You entered our home, savored the finest services money could buy, and never spent a single penny of your own!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A collective gasp rippled through the assembled crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The followers stared at Khloe and Meagan,completely stunned by this revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan stubbornly attempted to salvage her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>position. &#34;But when you girls fell ill, I was the one who nursed you back to health-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We maintained a private physician on retainer.I don&#39;t recall you providing any care whatsoever,&#34;Arabella interrupted, her voice cutting through the air like a blade. Her lips twisted into a frigid smile. &#34;Previously, I held my tongue because you&#39;re my aunt. I knew you were stealing and selling our belongings, but I allowed it to continue.Since you insist on creating this public spectacle,I&#39;m granting you one week to return every stolen dollar. Otherwise, prepare yourself for legal action.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow of dread crossed Meagan&#39;s features.Arabella continued relentlessly, &#34;And don&#39;t imagine you can escape consequences just because years have passed. Our villa&#39;s security system stores footage for seventy years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan&#39;s vision blurred, and she swayed dangerously close to collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe struggled to draw breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn Arabella! She truly represented their most formidable obstacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe,despite her seething anger, noticed the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>followers&#39; expressions shifting dramatically.&#34;Mom, is this actually true?&#34; she demanded,her voice breaking. &#34;I believed we were the ones covering all the expenses!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe stared at Meagan in complete disbelief,rage blazing across her features. &#34;I can&#39;t believe you even deceived me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan opened her mouth but found herself voiceless. Seeing the followers watching intently behind Khloe, she had no alternative but to stammer, &#34;I... I never intended to mislead you.l just wanted to secure the house so our family could live in comfort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d rather live without such tainted money!&#34;Khloe declared sorrowfully, then turned to address the followers directly. &#34;I&#39;m deeply sorry.I had no knowledge of the truth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The followers, who had initially burned with anger,witnessed Khloe&#39;s genuine remorse and couldn&#39;t bring themselves to condemn her. &#34;It&#39;s not your fault,Koko. You&#39;re a victim in this situation too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella scoffed, fixing Meagan wih a withering stare, and spoke softly. &#34;Your family&#39;s truly remarkable-you&#39;ll sacrifice each other whenever it serves your purposes. Aunt Meagan, I&#39;m giving</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you exactly one week. Remember to contact me regarding the money&#39;s return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those final words, Arabella departed alongside Gracie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracie insisted on treating Arabella to dinner,where she listened intently as Arabella recounted the years of betrayal and manipulation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracie&#39;s fury ignited. &#34;Meagan&#39;s absolutely a despicable woman, treating you and Daisy so cruelly! It&#39;s completely unforgivable. But | was foolish as well. I should have recognized she wouldn&#39;t possess the kindness to genuinely care for you two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guilt consumed Gracie entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella detected the authentic concern radiating from Gracie&#39;s eyes, and for a fleeting moment,she felt disoriented. She hadn&#39;t anticipated a neighbor caring so deeply about their welfare.Feeling somewhat uncomfortable, she replied,&#34;Everything&#39;s manageable now. I just feel sorry for Daisy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I&#39;d remained in the country during those years,I never would have allowed your aunt to torment her so mercilessly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracie&#39;s eyes blazed with profound regret as she continued, &#34;Your father stood apart as genuinely exceptional within that family. Meagan and the other relatives are all thoroughly duplicitous, but he possessed true honesty and remarkable kindness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Arabella&#39;s mind seized upon something Meagan had deliberately mentioned earlier.Her grandfather had raised her father from childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She retained few memories of her grandfather since he passed away shortly after her birth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, why would Meagan reference that detail so intentionally?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it possibly mean that her father wasn&#39;t actually born a Stanley?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s eyes narrowed as a profound sense of loss washed over her consciousness. Still, it hardly mattered anymore. Her parents had vanished from this world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and Daisy are genuinely good girls. Now that I&#39;ve come back, if you ever require assistance,simply reach out to me. Let&#39;s exchange our contact information.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracie and Arabella swapped their details with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>practiced efficiency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Arabella&#39;s phone chimed with an incoming transfer of two hundred thousand dollars. She frantically attempted to return the substantial sum, but Gracie remained adamant and said, &#34;Your father provided my family with immeasurable help over the years. Please accept this and use it to properly care for Daisy, won&#39;t you? If you refuse, it&#39;ll signal that you don&#39;t wish to maintain our connection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witnessing Gracie&#39;s unwavering determination,Arabella found herself with no alternative but to accept the generous gesture. &#34;Thank you so much,Mrs.Pearson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracie&#39;s face illuminated with a deeply gratified smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But precisely at that moment, her phone erupted with an urgent ring. Gracie&#39;s expression transformed drastically as she absorbed the caller&#39;s words, and when she finally ended the call, she spoke with barely contained urgency.&#34;Something critical has emerged. I may not be able to continue our dinner together after all.&#34;</p>
