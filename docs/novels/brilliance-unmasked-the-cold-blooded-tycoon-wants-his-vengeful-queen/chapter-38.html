                <p>Worry flickered in Elissa&#39;s eyes, but beneath the surface, she seethed with scorn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy had struggled to earn her spot at Griridge University. Arabella was gonna ruin her sister&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, all the noise and agitation brought the university president out of his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the newly arrived administrator,Joyce wasted no time. &#34;Sir, when will you be expelling Daisy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An eyebrow arched as the president replied,&#34;And what exactly is the reason for her expulsion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flashed as Joyce shouted, &#34;She&#39;s nothing but an ungrateful, heartless, and cruel person!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allowing someone like that to stay will only drag down the university&#39;s good name!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leveling a calm gaze, the president pressed her for proof. &#34;Can you support any of these accusations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Joyce insisted, &#34;Elissa can testify! After Daisy lost her parents, she was taken in by Elissa&#39;s family. Instead of showing gratitude, she turned around and bullied her benefactor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fascinating how you&#39;ve twisted things. So now,my parents&#39; house magically belongs to Elissa&#39;s family?&#34; Arabella&#39;s sharp, mocking tone broke through the gathering tension, which made everyone look her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Arabella appeared, the temperature in the group seemed to drop,though her words left many of them blinking in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce wasted no time scoffing, &#34;Your house?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Really, Daisy? Are you hearing yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk curled across Elissa&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ownership didn&#39;t matter now, anyway-the house was gone, and there was nothing Arabella could show to prove her claim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today,Elissa was set on one thing: making sure Arabella couldn&#39;t utter a single word in her own defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, in her mind, Arabella had started it by throwing her and her family out. If she was suffering now, well, Arabella would only brought it on herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa wore a look of wounded disappointment but finally found an outlet for her grievances.&#34;Family ties matter, yes. Still, Arabella, you can&#39;t just say the house is yours. Do you actually have proof?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cool confidence, Arabella reached for her phone. &#34;Who says I don&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, a buzz rippled through the crowd as a fresh post appeared on the school forum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads bowed over screens, students exchanged startled glances and tugged friends closer to see the update for themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bafflement swept over Joyce wvhen she noticed all eyes glued to their phones. Curiosity getting the better of her, she peered at a classmate&#39;s display-shock washed over her face the moment she read the post.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa, just as perplexed, felt her own device vibrate. The headline caught her eye. &#34;Who&#39;s actually living in my house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attached image left no room for debate-a clear photo of the property deed, Arabella&#39;s name shining on the title.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It turned out her parents had purchased the villa using Arabella&#39;s name as the owner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the students had spent time at Elissa&#39;s house before, and the address shown in the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>post was unmistakably the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervous whispers erupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this real, or did someone just fake it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone in the crowd chimed in, &#34;You can tell that&#39;s real-there&#39;s no way it&#39;s photoshopped.Does that mean the house actually belonged to Daisy&#39;s family? Is Arabella really her sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, worry flickered across Elissa&#39;s face, but she recovered swiftly. &#34;So y/ou think you can trick everyone with a simple post,Daisy? My parents only put the house in Arabella&#39;s name out of pity. The villa has always been ours by right!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The skeptical students, reassured by her confidence,let out a collective breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of relief swept through them; it seemed for a moment as if they had almost been misled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disdain replaced doubt as they turned cold glances back on Arabella, convinced she was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>simply scheming again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, mocking smile curved Arabella&#39;s lips.&#34;Do you honestly believe the truth can be buried with time, Elissa? That house belonged to me from the very beginning!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick tap of her finger sent another update live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill crept over Elissa as she scrolled to see the newest edit: the post now displayed a scanned image of the original purchase contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind went completely blank, panic rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had Arabella uncovered a document hidden for so long? And if that contract was real, what about the villa-wasn&#39;t it supposed to belong to that burly new owner now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elissa, say something! What is this about?&#34;Joyce&#39;s voice trembled as she turned anxious eyes to her friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speech deserted Elissa; her lips parted,but nothing came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The uncertainty etched across her face sent a ripple of dread through the crowd. Were they the ones who had been fooled this entire time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once my parents were gone, your family seized our home, treated me like a servant, and bullied me because I was just a kid,&#34; Arabella declared, sorrow mingling with bitter resentment in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage flickered beneath her sadness as she locked eyes with the students.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a swift motion, Arabella tossed a photograph into the air, letting it flutter down for everyone to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity surged as the students leaned in-right there in the center of the faded image stood Daisy, flanked by her parents, their posture proud, and another girl-Arabella herself, her face crudely scratched out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole group looked sophisticated, Daisy&#39;s parents radiating class and elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another family stood beside them, clearly Elissa&#39;s family-by comparison, their clothing was simple, the difference unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps rippled through the students. &#34;Wow,Daisy&#39;s mom was stunning! And her father-he looked so distinguished!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition dawned in one corner. &#34;Wait a minute, I know Daisy&#39;s dad! He worked with my father years ago!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it turns out Elissa&#39;s family took over Daisy&#39;s house? Where does Elissa get off distorting everything like she&#39;s the victim?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of disbelief washed over Joyce as she studied the photograph in her hand. She fixed Elissa with a wary stare, inching away as if meeting her for the first time. &#34;All this time, have you been feeding me nothing but lies, Elissa?&#34;</p>
