                <p>Joyce and her group were hit with a wave of fear. The two men standing in front of them gave off such a strong, scary presence that it made their skin crawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first crack came from one of the boys.His voice wobbled as he dropped to his knees in front of Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of his apology cut through the room like glass on tile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his gaze glued to the floor, terrified to make eye contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His family didn&#39;t have a safety net, just a humble business built from scratch by his parents. If it went under, his future would be ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella looked down at him, her face impossible to read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another second passed, and then came the next collapse. Another boy slammed to his knees beside the first. &#34;I&#39;m sorry!&#34; he cried,louder this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had tried to hold out, but with his family&#39;s stocks plunging into free fall, pride became a luxury he couldn&#39;t afford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood frozen, her blood boiling. They were apologizing to her? Daisy? What the hell was wrong with them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met Arabella&#39;s gaze with fire in her eyes.&#34;You must be delusional if you think I&#39;d ever kneel to you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her phone buzzed. A news alert. &#34;Lambert Group stock hits lower limit.&#34; The words felt like a slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vision blurred. Her legs buckled under the weight of it, and she crumpled to the floor, too</p>
                
                
                
                <p>stunned to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa wasn&#39;t doing much better. Her phone lit up with panicked messages from her family group chat, everyone losing it astheir stocks free-fell, wondering if they had offended someone powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Arabella, her eyes glossy with desperation. &#34;Daisy... we&#39;re basically family,aren&#39;t we? Can&#39;t you go easy on us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, clinging to her pride, spat bitterly, &#34;You freeloading bitch! You lived off Elissa&#39;s family,ate their meals, and slept in their home, and now you want us to beg? You&#39;re not even worth the dirt on my shoe!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella stayed cool as ever, casually inspecting her nails, like their words were nothing more than a dull buzz in the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That silent indifference was a slap harder than any insult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s fury burned hotter than ever, but deep</p>
                
                
                
                <p>down, fear was starting to take over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, with a loud thud, she fell to her knees. &#34;I&#39;m sorry!&#34; she shouted, clearly not meaning it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s eyes turned cold, and her voice was flat. &#34;You think that counts as an apology?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce bit down so hard she could taste blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her frustration, she knew better than to keep pushing. If her family&#39;s company collapsed, so would everything she had built-her image, her status, her power. Swallowing her pride, she mumbled, &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Joyce surrender, Elissa went pale.She stared at Arabella, completely thrown. This wasn&#39;t the same pushover she used to boss around. This girl standing in front of her now was someone else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Red-faced and burning with humiliation, Elissa lowered herself to her knees, the shame soaking into her skin. &#34;Daisy, I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>whispered, each syllable tasting worse than bile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick calmly slid his phone into his pocket.&#34;That&#39;s one part done. Now onto the next. Ten laps around the racetrack. Keep apologizing as you run.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, Elissa, and the others looked stunned,like the air had been knocked out of them. Their faces fell right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa, desperate, turned to Arabella with shaky words. &#34;Daisy, are you serious? You&#39;re really going to make us do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella tilted her head, the faintest smirk curling on her lips. &#34;Wait, wasn&#39;t this your brilliant idea?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s mouth opened, but no words came.Nothing she said could flip this situation anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she passed by Dominick, she shot him a look full of teary-eyed desperation, but he didn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>even blink. Her only option was to grit her teeth and move on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Asher turned to the president, his tone razor-sharp and deliberate. &#34;You can pack up your office and leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Mr. Gordon!&#34; the president blurted,falling to his knees in panic. &#34;I&#39;m begging you!Give me one more chance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt like his entire career was crumbling to ash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had fought tooth and nail to become the president, and now everything was slipping through his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Asher didn&#39;t even glance at him. Instead, his attention shifted back to Arabella. &#34;Miss Stanley, don&#39;t you want front-row seats to this little spectacle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave him a thoughtful look, clearly impressed. &#34;Well, since you went to all this trouble, it&#39;d be rude to miss the main act,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wouldn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s eyes twitched slightly with a half-smile.He seemed to enjoy her boldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the energy was electric. Word had already spread like wildfire, and the students had gathered, phones out, eyes wide, ready for the drama to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one expected Elissa and her gang to come out with teary eyes, heading straight to the racetrack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry! I messed up!&#34; one of them yelled while jogging, and the rest repeated it again and again, their voices following them like a chant as they ran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd stood frozen, stunned beyond belief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable! Joyce and her squad? Getting punished? For real?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce ddeserves it, though. She&#39;s a bully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, Joyce has bullied Daisy forever. Sure,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy fought back hard, but Joyce isn&#39;t exactly innocent either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella was standing quietly by the racetrack and observing when a girl walked up to her,looking both amazed and unsure. &#34;Wait... you&#39;re not really Daisy, are you?&#34;</p>
