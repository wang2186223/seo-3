                <p>&#34;We do need to meet up,&#34; Asher responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie Hudson didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Let&#39;s go to Bob&#39;s restaurant.How about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That works for me.&#34; Their chat was brief, and Asher ended the call soon after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting her phone aside, Rosie was immediately approached by Bob, who asked eagerly, &#34;Did Asher agree to meet you tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, he did.&#34; Rosie nodded, a small smile on her lips as she glanced at her reflection in the mirror. Her features were as delicate as ever,and she couldn&#39;t help but feel a flicker of satisfaction. &#34;I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d say yes so fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recalled how, last time, she had expected Asher to come collect her,but he hadn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>bothered to show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make matters worse, rumors swirled that Asher had brought another woman with him that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie had been fuming when she found out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being a Hudson lady and the most well-known socialite in Ockford, Rosie had always known that both her family and the Gordons wanted her to marry Asher. He never gave a definite yes or no, leaving her hanging, which felt like a slap in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Rosie calmed down and saw things from Asher&#39;s perspective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood there was no sense in pushing a man who was used to getting his way,especially someone with Asher&#39;s background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob didn&#39;t hesitate to flatter her. &#34;Naturally, he said yes. There isn&#39;t a single person in Ockford who measures up to you. If you two end up together, he&#39;s hit the jackpot!&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned and added, &#34;Just wait, when you and your fiancé visit, I&#39;ll make sure the whole city knows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie shot him a playful look. &#34;Fiancé? We&#39;re not officially engaged yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob flashed her a confident grin. &#34;It&#39;s just a matter of time, you&#39;ll see. Now, I&#39;d better get going on tomorrow night&#39;s menu. I&#39;ll make sure you and Asher have a meal to remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie nodded in agreement, then paused as something came to mind. &#34;Oh, have you seen that new restaurant across the street? It actually looks pretty fancy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob let out a dismissive laugh. &#34;They think they can open an upscale place nearby? That&#39;s wishful thinking. Give it a few months, they&#39;ll be packing up and leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, Arabella accompanied Daisy to dance practice with the troupe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Daisy blend in so well with the other</p>
                
                
                
                <p>dancers put Arabella at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bit of free time on her hands, Arabella wandered over to Jennifer&#39;s office. But when she arrived, she realized Jennifer already had company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office door was cracked open, and Zoe&#39;s anxious voice carried into the hallway. &#34;Ms.Dawson, my student is incredibly gifted. Can&#39;t you reconsider and make an exception for us?It&#39;s been ages since l&#39;ve had a student stand out. If this keeps up, my days at this facility are numbered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long ago, both Elissa and Joyce had been expelled, and their teacher, Zoe,lost her job for failing to supervise them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole ordeal had hit Zoe hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now Zoe was stuck teaching at a tutoring center, and her reputation was on the line.Getting her current student into the dance troupe could turn things around, and maybe</p>
                
                
                
                <p>attract new pupils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer&#39;s tone was sharp, her patience clearly worn thin. &#34;I told you before, you already had an excellent student. The problem was you never valued her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s expression soured. &#34;I couldn&#39;t have guessed Elissa would get mixed up in something like that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elissa?&#34; Jennifer repeated, her brows lifting in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, weren&#39;t you talking about Elissa?&#34; Zoe asked, her confusion written all over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer rolled her eyes, but her attention shifted as she caught sight of Arabella in the doorway. Even with her mask and hat, there was no mistaking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a quiet nod in greeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer caught on immediately and didn&#39;t bother sugarcoating her words. &#34;No, I was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>referring to Daisy. Elissa isn&#39;t even relevant here. Honestly, Zoe, you really can&#39;t spot talent when it&#39;s right in front of you, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daisy?&#34; Zoe blurted out, suddenly at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, she had always known Daisy had skill,but after the girl&#39;s leg injury, she never considered her a contender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if Jennifer, the notoriously tough judge,was offering praise, then Daisy must have serious potential.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The previous dancer Jennifer had complimented went on to become an unexpected sensation, earning recognition all across the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret washed over Zoe. If she had stepped in and stopped the bullying earlier, maybe she wouldn&#39;t have lost her position. If she had given Daisy a chance, perhaps she would have discovered a star in her own classroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now Zoe&#39;s reputation was in ruins, and once news of her dismissal.spread, the most talented students made sure to steer clear of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with only part-time gigs at a tutoring center, she scraped by on the bare minimum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confronted with her situation, Zoe finally saw how far she had fallen, and where she was likely headed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe wandered out of the office, her thoughts spinning with regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no amount of remorse could rewrite the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Zoe had left, Arabella stepped inside.Jennifer&#39;s face brightened at the sight of her. &#34;I have to say, Daisy&#39;s got real talent. She fits in perfectly with the troupe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella managed a small smile. &#34;Thank you for giving her a chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, lowering her voice. &#34;There&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>something else. I think someone in the association has Lailah&#39;s back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer&#39;s expression shifted to shock. &#34;Who could it be?&#34; &#34;I haven&#39;t narrowed it down yet,&#34;Arabella replied, calm and steady. &#34;But whoever it is, they have significant access. I reported Lailah&#39;s misconduct, and it never made it to the top.&#34;</p>
