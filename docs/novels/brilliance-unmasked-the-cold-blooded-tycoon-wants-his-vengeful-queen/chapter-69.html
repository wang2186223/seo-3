                <p>Arabella saw Daisy&#39;s eyes welling up and gently stepped in to comfort her. &#34;Daisy, you matter more to me than anything else. Trust me,compared to what I&#39;ve been through, this is barely a bump in the road. Don&#39;t stress, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s brows furrowed with worry. &#34;Have things really been that bad for you all this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella hesitated for a second, then gave a small, almost forced smile. &#34;There are things I can&#39;t talk about right now. Not because I don&#39;t want to, but... I just can&#39;t. Still, I promise... I can handle it. I&#39;ve always been able to. Okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy didn&#39;t push the issue. She nodded slowly,sensing that Arabella had her reasons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her eyes scanned Arabella&#39;s face and figure with worry. &#34;Are you hurt anywhere?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a reassuring smile. &#34;I&#39;m alright,promise. Since you finally get a day out, let me show you something nice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy nodded again, this time with a bit more spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t often Daisy got to go out, and everything around her seemed so new and interesting. Arabella led her to a high-end boutique, its elegant design exuding wealth and class. Daisy hesitated, shrinking back a little.&#34;Should we really go in? This place looks way too pricey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; Arabella said, tugging her along. &#34;I&#39;ve been working hard to earn enough for both of us. Didn&#39;t you see? I transferred some money to you a while ago. Why haven&#39;t you spent any of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy looked up with honest eyes. &#34;Because I know how hard you work for it... and really, I haven&#39;t needed anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s smile faltered alittle. When she first saw Daisy earlier, she had immediately noticed her clothes-faded, outdated, and clearly secondhand. Even her undergarments looked old and worn-out. That quiet frugality tugged at her heart in the worst way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gently took Daisy&#39;s hand in hers, her voice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>low but firm. &#34;Everything I do-all the hustle,all the pain-it&#39;s so you can have more than this.If you don&#39;t let yourself live better, then what&#39;s the point of me doing any of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s voice quivered as her eyes filled with tears. &#34;Then don&#39;t push yourself so hard. I don&#39;t need much to be happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella stared at her, briefly speechless. For once, she didn&#39;t have a comeback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy added with soft determination, &#34;And once I get a job, it&#39;ll be my turn to take care of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That one sentence hit Arabella harder than anything else. Her chest tightened, but she smiled gently and gave Daisy&#39;s hands a soft squeeze. &#34;I do it because I want to, Daisy,&#34; she said softly. &#34;I know you&#39;d never ask me to go through any of it, but if you told me to live some boring, average life? I&#39;d say no in a heartbeat. This is what I chose. So if I&#39;m out there doing everything I can, and you won&#39;t even enjoy any of it, then what&#39;s the point? It would mean nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, Arabella hadn&#39;t really had much say in how her life played out, not since her talent was discovered. From that moment on,it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was like someone else had taken the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy finally gave a tiny smile. &#34;Okay,I understand. I&#39;ll do as you say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella grinned. &#34;That&#39;s more like it. Come on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boutique was airy and elegant, with only a handful of quiet shoppers. Racks of beautifully tailored clothing lined the walls like artwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the sales assistants, her lips painted a bold red, was busy chatting on the phone. That was Kate Baxter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You absolutely have to stop by, Miss Hudson,&#34;Kate said, her voice sweet and flattering.&#34;Everything&#39;s been prepared just for you. No one else gets this kind of service,you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Kate continued her call, a younger assistant,Ruth Shannon, gently tapped her shoulder and whispered, &#34;Kate, it&#39;s your rotation now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kate glanced over at the two girls who had just walked in. After giving them a quick once-over,she scoffed slightly and told Ruth, &#34;You deal with them. I&#39;m on the line with Miss Hudson-an actual customer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruth hesitated, but when she saw Kate still giggling into her phone like she didn&#39;t have a care in the world, she decided to take the initiative and approached them with a polite smile. &#34;Welcome! Can I assist you with anything today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re here for clothes,&#34; Arabella replied curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, come this way,&#34; Ruth said, leading them inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella guided Daisy around the store and picked out a few outfits for her to try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Kate finally finished her phone call.She glanced over and saw Daisy holding a bunch of clothes. With a sneer, she leaned toward Ruth and muttered, &#34;Hurry up and get them out of here. They clearly can&#39;t afford this stuff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruth didn&#39;t respond. She just gave a soft sigh,clearly annoyed by Kate&#39;s constant snobbish attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, before any more comments could be made, the entrance bell chimed again. Kate turned and suddenly brightened. &#34;Oh my</p>
                
                
                
                <p>goodness! Mr. Johnson, what a surprise!&#34; she said cheerfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella was sitting on the couch, looking at her phone. When she heard the name &#34;Mr.Johnson,&#34; her head lifted quickly. The moment she saw his face, her expression turned cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob Johnson walked in proudly and said, &#34;I&#39;m here to pick out some gifts for my cousin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kate beamed and gushed, &#34;I was just on the phone with your cousin! You two are so sweet.So,what are we shopping for today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob opened his mouth to respond, but then his eyes landed on Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rubbed his eyes, wondering if he was imagining it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daisy?&#34; he said slowly,completely shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the woman looked nothing like the shy girl he remembered.Her cold,sharp stare made him uneasy. This couldn&#39;t be Daisy. She seemed too confident, too powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Daisy came out of the fitting room and called softly, &#34;Bella.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a smile on her face until she saw Bob.Then her expression darkened, and her body started to shake a little with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he doing here? Why now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob looked at Daisy, finally realizing she was the one he knew. That meant the other woman,so calm and fierce, had to be her sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twins? Now that was something</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered how Daisy had caught his eye the first day she worked at his store. She was beautiful, quiet, and graceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he never expected her to have a twin sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ideas started running through his head. If he could win over both sisters, his friends would be green with envy.</p>
