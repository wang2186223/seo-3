                <p>Arabella didn&#39;t text back. She quietly continued eating, though her expression remained frosty the entire time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the air made Daisy uneasy too.She didn&#39;t dare break the silence. But as she studied Arabella&#39;s face, an anxious feeling crept into her chest-was it possible that Arabella had feelings for Asher too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t clear, but she could sense a hint of fruIstration behind Arabella&#39;s calm exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over at the upscale restaurant, Rosie had just arrived. She casually posed near the window,subtly leaning closer to Asher while chatting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw a paparazzo in the distance flash an &#34;OK&#34; hand sign. Pleased, she turned to Asher with a soft smile. &#34;How&#39;s the food here? Do you like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Asher&#39;s attention was elsewhere. His eyes were glued to his phone-Arabella hadn&#39;t replied,and that unsettled him. Without looking up, he</p>
                
                
                
                <p>replied flatly, &#34;I didn&#39;t come here to eat. I have something serious to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie straightened up instantly, her heart racing with anticipation. &#34;Alright, I&#39;m listening,&#34; she said eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this it? Wlas Asher finally going to accept the proposal their families had been pushing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the elegant and undeniably attractive man before her, Rosie struggled to keep her excitement in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Asher&#39;s next words hit her like a slap. &#34;Tell your family to drop the marriage talk. I don&#39;t want it brought up again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was unreadable, but his entire demeanor gave off a chilling vibe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie froze in shock, staring at him in disbelief.&#34;What did you just say, Asher?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not that familiar,&#34; he said coolly.&#34;You can just call me Mr. Gordon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie felt like the ground had dropped beneath her. She nearly bit her tongue, stunned and humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then... Mr. Gordon,&#34; she said through clenched teeth, trying to steady her voice, &#34;can I at least ask why? I mean, in terms of status, I&#39;m your best match. And I&#39;m not exactly lacking in looks either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher didn&#39;t even blink. &#34;That&#39;s not something you need to ask,&#34; he said bluntly. &#34;Going forward,keep your distance. And I don&#39;t want to see any more rumors linking us together. If I have to clarify things publicly, it&#39;ll only make things worse for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he stood and left without a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie sank into her seat like all the strength had been drained from her, completely stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Bob came rushing over. &#34;What happened? Why did Asher leave like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie didn&#39;t answer. Her hands clenched tightly in her lap as she stared at the table. Her vision blurred with tears, and it took every ounce of willpower not to flip the table in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob could tell something was very wrong. A chilling thought crept into his mind-had Asher</p>
                
                
                
                <p>never intended to marry Rosie at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you ask him why? Honestly, who could be a better match than you?&#34; Bob tried to comfort her. &#34;Look, if a man turns down someone like you,there are only two possible reasons-either he&#39;s not into women, or he&#39;s already got someone else in his heart. Love&#39;s weird like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not gay!&#34; Rosie snapped without hesitation.Anyone could tell Asher was straight. Her jaw clenched in frustration. &#34;So he really is into someone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob replied, &#34;Then we just need to find out who it is. Maybe he&#39;s just momentarily blinded. You&#39;re from a powerful family-he&#39;s bound to come back around. Don&#39;t let one rejection shake you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words jolted Rosie back to her senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right-she had let one blow shake her too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regaining her calm, Rosie adjusted her tone,measured and elegant. &#34;You&#39;re right. The Gordon family wouldn&#39;t allow him to marry just anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly pulled out her phone, got in touch</p>
                
                
                
                <p>with the paparazzo, and had all posts tying her to Asher taken down. Then she posted a clarification, stating they were only friends and had no engagement plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her statement quickly won public favor online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if they aren&#39;t getting married now, they totally will later!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rosie is so gracious-clearing things up instead of clinging to fame like certain attention-seekers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That kind of class is why Rosie&#39;s at the top of the social ladder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With comments flooding in like praise songs,Rosie smiled with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after Asher left, he saw Arabella and Daisy walking out of the restaurant across the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked like the place had just recently opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, Joshua stepped out, and Asher made his way over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua was on a call with his driver when Asher suddenly appeared. He jumped a little. &#34;Mr.Gordon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher gave a curt nod. &#34;Is this your new restaurant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Technically, it belongs to Arabella,&#34; he answered truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as her name came up, Asher&#39;s gaze darkened slightly. Why would she suddenly decide to open a restaurant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment he met her, it always felt like every step she took was part of some bigger plan -usually tied to revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only real competition this new place she was opening posed wNas to Bob&#39;s upscale restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua saw Asher glance at the street and instantly broke into a cold sweat. His sixth sense was terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua gave up the act. &#34;You&#39;re right. She opened it to compete with Bob. But we&#39;ve been stuck all day trying to come up with a menu that works.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wants it to be both nutritious and tasty,which is hard. You&#39;ve tasted her food, so you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>know,&#34; Joshua added with a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After thinking for a beat, Asher said, &#34;I&#39;ll send over our family chef in ten minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua blinked. &#34;Wait, are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher replied, &#34;He can try making something that fits Arabella&#39;s standards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua stood there stunned. Was this really happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Asher got into his car and placed a call to his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the Gordon family&#39;s estate. Cecily Gordon -elegant and graceful-was watering her garden.When she saw the name on her phone, her brows lifted in surprise. It was her son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered, her tone playful. &#34;Well now, what a rare treat. You&#39;re calling me personally? What do you need?&#34;</p>
