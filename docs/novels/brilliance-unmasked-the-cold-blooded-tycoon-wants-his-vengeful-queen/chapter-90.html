                <p>Vanessa felt thoroughly humiliated by Arabella&#39;s sharp tongue, yet, frustratingly, she couldn&#39;t find any real fault to argue with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a while, Arabella. You seem to be doing quite well,&#34; Vanessa said stiffly, pushing aside her half-eaten meal and sitting down beside the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave her a faint smile, laced with mockery. &#34;We&#39;re surviving, thanks to Aunt Meagan&#39;s overflowing kindness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan shot up from her seat, shrieking, &#34;You little bitch! What nonsense are you spewing now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vanessa&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;Watch your tone. I heard you snatched the house from Meagan. Have you forgotten we&#39;re family? Blood ties don&#39;t just disappear. What you&#39;ve done is heartless. Return the house to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella looked genuinely confused. &#34;Snatched the house? Was it even under her name? If I really took something that wasn&#39;t mine, why hasn&#39;t she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>gone to the police?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was calm, but every word dripped with biting irony. Vanessa&#39;s face twisted in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That house was bought by your father,&#34; Vanessa said, her voice tightening. &#34;But he&#39;s no longer here, and Meagan has cared for you all these years.Why can&#39;t you just let her have it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cared for us?&#34; Arabella gave a short laugh. &#34;You mean Daisy took care of her while she was tormenting Daisy nonstop?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she tossed a file onto the table-it was Daisy&#39;s medical report and her case notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vanessa flipped through the documents, and the more she read, the darker her expression became. With a loud thud, she slammed the papers back in Meagan&#39;s direction.&#34;What is this?How could you treat Daisy like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| didn&#39;t mean to.&#34; Meagan panicked. &#34;She brought it on herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re her aunt. Couldn&#39;t you have shown a little compassion?&#34; Vanessa barked. Her tone sounded angry, but her eyes didn&#39;t show much blame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then turned back to Arabella, her voice softer. &#34;Arabella, don&#39;t worry. Meagan&#39;s cleary in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the wrong, and I&#39;ll make sure she&#39;s punished. But I still believe she didn&#39;t mean it. She&#39;s watched over you and Daisy for years, anyway. Can&#39;t you just let her have the house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella leaned back into the sofa and said firmly,&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vanessa looked shocked. &#34;Arabella! Are you really going to disobey your family like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Grandma. But if standing up for myself means going against you, then yes-because you&#39;re trying to take something that belongs to me,&#34; Arabella replied coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vanessa didn&#39;t expect such a direct reply and looked furious. &#34;We&#39;re your family! What rights or property are you even talking about? I&#39;m giving you one last chance.Give the house to Meagan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s tone remained calm. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vanessa was so furious that her chest began to tighten painfully. She clutched it instinctively,and in the next moment, her knees gave out and she collapsed to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa rushed over and bent down to check on her, glaring up at Arabella. &#34;How could you say that to your own grandmother? You&#39;re so</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ungrateful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella looked down at Vanessa. &#34;My father gave you more than enough. This house included.Please know your limits. If you keep trying to take what doesn&#39;t belong to you, l&#39;ll take back everything my father gave-in his name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words only made Vanessa more furious. She slowly got up from the floor with rage burning in her eyes. &#34;Your father owed everything to us!Without our help, he would&#39;ve died on the streets.Don&#39;t forget that he was adopted by me! He wasn&#39;t even my real son!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella narrowed her eyes, a bit stunned that Vanessa had actually said it out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy, on the other hand, stood frozen. &#34;Dad...wasn&#39;t born into the Stanley family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vanessa&#39;s expression darkened with spite as she continued, &#34;Years ago, during a snowstorm, I saw a car slow down and toss something by the roadside. I went to check, and it was a baby,nearly frozen to death. If I hadn&#39;t stepped in, he wouldn&#39;t have made it through the night. Even though we were barely getting by back then, I still took him in. I gave him food and shelter and raised him like my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She locked eyes with Arabella. &#34;So now do you understand,Arabella?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for me, your father wouldn&#39;t have existed, and without him, there&#39;d be no you! So everything you are, everything you have... it all belongs to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella slowly lowered her head. &#34;So... that&#39;s the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vanessa raised her chin, proud and certain.&#34;Exactly. Now tell me-do you still have the nerve to say that house is yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella said nothing. She just sat there quietly,not giving away a single emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vanessa softened her tone, mixing sympathy with pressure. &#34;I know this is a lot to take in. But think carefully. We&#39;re the only family you&#39;ve got.Without us, you and Daisy really have no one else in this world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing both sisters still in shock, Vanessa took the chance to get up. &#34;You two stay here and think it over. I&#39;m going for a walk with Meagan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left the room, hoping the silence would be enough to make Arabella change her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they left, Daisy turned to her. &#34;Do you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>think it&#39;s true? That Dad wasn&#39;t Grandma&#39;s biological son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her attitude makes it pretty clear,&#34; Arabella responded, lifting her head. &#34;But no. I don&#39;t believe the story she told. I don&#39;t think Dad was just some baby she found in the snow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! She&#39;s always been stingy. Why would she take in a stranger&#39;s child for no reason?&#34;Daisy&#39;s hands balled into fists. &#34;Let&#39;s just leave.There&#39;s no way we&#39;re giving her anything Dad left behind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella nodded slowly. &#34;We will.But not just yet.&#34;Her voice turned sharp, her eyes steady. &#34;I want to find out the real reason she took Dad in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Arabella had guessed, after dropping the truth, Vanessa thought she was being smart-thinking that dropping a shocking truth and walking away would give them time to regret everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t know Arabella well enough. She couldn&#39;t be tricked that easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella stood up and led Daisy upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their father had bought this house long before they were born.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had to be something left behind or some clue that could tell them what really happened.</p>
