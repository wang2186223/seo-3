                <p>Asher spoke in his usual calm way. &#34;I hardly ever showed up for school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That did not surprise Arabella. Someone in his position, with all the privileges of a wealthy family,probably found regular classes far too simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice called out from nearby, &#34;Hey,you two!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Asher and Arabella turned around and saw a girl with a camera hanging around her neck.She looked like any other student wandering the campus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl&#39;s cheeks glowed with excitement. &#34;I was walking around taking pictures and just had to get one of you together. Honestly, you both look amazing-like a pair straight out of a magazine! Let me give you a copy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She handed over the photograph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella accepted it. The picture showed her looking up at the fluttering maple leaves, while</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher gazed at her. The whole scene looked soft and romantic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle warmth spread through Arabella&#39;s chest as she studied the photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still bubbling with excitement, the girl asked,&#34;You make such a striking pair. Which department do you belong to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not...&#34; Arabella tried to clear things up.But before she could finish, Asher interjected,&#34;We only came for the event.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl grinned and nodded. &#34;Got it! I&#39;ll let you enjoy your time, then. Have a wonderful day!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she had gone, Arabella traced her fingers over the photograph. &#34;She definitely got the wrong idea about us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher stayed unfazed. &#34;It doesn&#39;t really matter.Is there somewhere else you&#39;d like to see?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella glanced toward a building with a square shape, set apart from the rest. &#34;What&#39;s that building over there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher replied, &#34;That&#39;s the laboratory building.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she heard this, Arabella&#39;s curiosity grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would it be alright if I looked around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher responded without hesitation, &#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They headed toward the building, passing through strict security thanks to Asher. Once inside, Arabella watched robots move around the space, her eyes shining with excitement.She spent a few moments interacting with one of them, completely absorbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their steps carried them deeper into the lab when, all at once, a door burst open and something shot out toward them. Arabella tensed, getting ready to dodge, but before she could move, Asher swept her into his arms,shielding her from danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It turned out that the object was only a malfunctioning robot, which jerked and wobbled right in front of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young man in a lab coat rushed over. &#34;Sorry!Oh no, I&#39;m so sorry!&#34; he exclaimed. This was River Lopez, a junior in Asher&#39;s old department.Though Asher had already graduated, River clearly remembered him.&#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>River&#39;s eyes widened when he saw Asher. &#34;Wait,Asher? Is that you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella suddenly realized she was still caught in Asher&#39;s embrace and quickly stepped away.Asher greeted River simply. &#34;Hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>River&#39;s expression changed from surprise to excitement. &#34;Is this your girlfriend?&#34; he asked,his eyes full of curiosity and a hint of mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella thought Asher would deny it,but instead, he turned the conversation. &#34;What are you working on right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>River&#39;s enthusiasm faded as he explained, &#34;I just finished building this robot, but now it&#39;s malfunctioning. I&#39;ve checked everything, and l can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faulty robot kept twitching and shifting where it stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella moved closer to inspect the robot.&#34;Would you mind if I take a look at it?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>River hesitated. &#34;Well... I guess, but...&#34; He looked doubtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher chimed in, &#34;Let her give it a shot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Asher had spoken, River agreed and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>invited Arabella to step into the lab for a closer look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella got right to work on the robot, and her expert handling left River completely astonished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>River could not hide his excitement. &#34;Wow,your girlfriend is incredible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s lips curled into the faintest of smiles,even though his voice remained steady. &#34;She really is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>River watched her in admiration, then blurted out, &#34;She looks pretty young though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher answered without hesitation, &#34;She&#39;s nineteen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>River stared at him, visibly taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s girlfriend was so much younger than him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill crept into Asher&#39;s eyes, his expression growing a little more serious. River immediately tried to smooth things over. &#34;No offense meant!Honestly, you two make a great pair. A real dream team!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Asher&#39;s expression eased a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about thirty minutes, Arabella finished her repairs and gave the robot an instruction. &#34;Go shake hands with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The robot moved straight toward River, held out its hand, and showed no signs of its earlier problems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>River could only stare, amazed. He had not expected someone so young to know so much about artificial intelligence, but the proof was right in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squatted down to look the robot over,finally spotting the error he had missed,and then glanced up at Arabella with new respect.&#34;You really are something else! When did you start seeing Asher?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella frowned, surprised by the label.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>River blinked. &#34;Wait, aren&#39;t you together?&#34;</p>
