                <p>&#34;No freaking way!&#34; Joyce shouted, her voice bouncing off the walls. &#34;Daisy? With that messed-up leg? How did she get chosen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe sighed. &#34;It came from the top. The decision&#39;s final. Now let&#39;s focus-class is starting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other students looked at Arabella with jealous eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the lesson dragged on, soft whispers passed between students like background static.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daisy used to be an amazing dancer. I saw her performance yesterday, and she&#39;s even better now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same here. Honestly, Elissa can&#39;t hold a candle to her anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once class ended and Zoe walked out, Joyce</p>
                
                
                
                <p>marched straight toward Arabella, but Elissa stepped in, blocking her path with a subtle shake of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the day went by quietly. No one tried to make Arabella&#39;s life miserable until after school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella stepped into the restroom and entered one of the stalls, locking the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, heavy footsteps echoed into the tiled space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well... where are you, Daisy?&#34; Joyce called out mockingly, laughing as she kicked open one stall after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two bulky girls flanked her, clearly ready to back her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s lips curled into a wicked grin when she reached the final door. &#34;There you are. Playing hide-and-seek with me all day, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her foot to kick the door, and before</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she could hit it, Arabella shoved the door open from inside, slamming it right into Joyce&#39;s leg.The pain shot up instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared at Arabella, who stood there calmly,then shouted, &#34;Grab her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two heavyset girls lunged, dragging Arabella out roughly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a voice called out from the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it! This isn&#39;t right!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Kaitlyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Back off, Kaitlyn! Stay out of this!&#34; Joyce snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaitlyn glanced at Arabella, clearly worried, but Arabella&#39;s expression stayed cool and composed. She silently mouthed, &#34;Get out of here.I can handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaitlyn hesitated, caught off guard by the calm confidence in her friend&#39;s eyes. It didn&#39;t feel like the same Daisy she used to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella mouthed again, firmer this time, &#34;Go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaitlyn gave a small nod, clenched her fists, and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, it was just the four of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You humiliated me yesterday, and now you&#39;re gonna pay!&#34; Joyce shouted and swung a punch at Arabella&#39;s face. Arabella dodged with a quick tilt of her head, making Joyce even angrier. She tried to grab Arabella&#39;s hair, but Arabella kicked her hard, sending her straight to the floor. Joyce groaned, holding her stomach in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two idiots, hold her down!&#34; Joyce yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two bigger girls rushed over and pushed Arabella to the floor. One of them hit her in frustration. &#34;What&#39;s your problem? Just stay down,bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, seething, snatched a mop bucket nearby and stormed over, her eyes blazing. &#34;You&#39;re finished,Daisy! You hear me? Done!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in a flash, Arabella slipped free, grabbed both women by the head, and slammed them together. Dirty water flew everywhere, soaking them as they stumbled back in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh! That&#39;s nasty!&#34; one shrieked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch where you&#39;re swinging, Joyce!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It stinks like sewer water!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girls scrambled, squealing and flailing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce snapped. &#34;What the hell is wrong with you two? You can&#39;t even take down one person?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two bulky women tried to grab Arabella again, but she quickly stepped back and kicked hard, sending one of them flying into the wall.She hit the floor, coughing up blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella then turned to the other girl,who was shaking and slowly backing away in fear. &#34;No...Please...don&#39;t!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella grabbed her by the hair, twisted her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>around, and flung her toward the wall. Her body hit hard, and she slid down, groaning and retching on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood frozen, struggling to process what she just witnessed. &#34;No! This isn&#39;t Daisy,&#34; she muttered, completely ratled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dealing with the girls, Arabella slowly turned her eyes on Joyce and started walking toward her. Joyce&#39;s bravado vanished in an instant. She backed away, trembling, like she was staring down a nightmare. &#34;W-who are you? What are you?&#34; she stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and tried to run, but Arabella yanked her back by the hair, slammed the restroom door shut, and threw her onto the floor. She pinned Joyce down with a foot pressed firmly on her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34; Arabella asked quietly,almost taunting. &#34;Elissa&#39;s not here with you this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sobbed. &#34;Elissa&#39;s at a meeting with the CEO of Vanguard Group! She&#39;s about to be his wife-if you hurt me, she&#39;ll destroy you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s smile didn&#39;t reach her eyes. &#34;No, she won&#39;t,&#34; she said flatly. Then she glanced around. &#34;So... just the four of us? That&#39;s no fun at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dropped, low and chilling. &#34;Let&#39;s play a game instead.&#34;</p>
