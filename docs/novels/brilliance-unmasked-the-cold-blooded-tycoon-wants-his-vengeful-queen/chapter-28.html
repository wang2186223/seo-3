                <p>Kenzie felt that jab cut straight through her pride,and her cheeks flushed with anger. She clenched her jaw and snapped, &#34;At least I didn&#39;t end up being walked all over!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after that, the crowd erupted into a sea of hushed voices and muttered rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,come see this for yourselves!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is beyond gross. Elissa owes us all an explanation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t there a video of Elissa&#39;s dance floating around Griridge University&#39;s forum? Did she seriously rip someone off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even a moment had passed after Elissa&#39;s group left the stage before people started talking,their stares cold and accusing. Elissa could feel their eyes following her every move, and confusion clouded her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a rush, Zoe appeared, shoved her phone in front of Elissa, and asked, &#34;What is this about?Why does your routine look exactly like the one</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie uploaded to the forum?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Elissa caught a glimpse of the video, the blood drained from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had used Kenzie&#39;s moves as her own. But admitting it was out of the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There must be some mistake. I created this choreography myself,&#34; Elissa responded. She turned to Kenzie and said, &#34;That was my work,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie never expected her post on the school forum to cause this much trouble. She wondered how everything had escalated so quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With dozens of eyes locked on her, Kenzie had no choice but to play along. &#34;Yes, Elissa did all the choreography.I was just fooling around onstage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet sigh slipped out from Elissa, but a sharp,frosty look flickered in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie had posted that video behind her back,clearly hoping to get her in trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly,Kenzie would have to pay for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then how do you explain these comments?&#34;someone called out from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Insults from Kenzie sat right under the video,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>glaring for everyone to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stole my work, Elissa! I put my heart into that dance, and you just took it like it was nothing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone&#39;s going to find out who you really are.You can&#39;t fake it forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick flick of herthumb,Zoe read through the comments, her face growing more and more grim as she looked over at Elissa, completely stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years, Zoe had always respected Elissa,especially since she was close to Zoe&#39;s niece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any hint of plagiarism could destroy Elissa&#39;s standing in the troupe, and she would be gone in a heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressure mounted i Elissa&#39;s chest, sending a cold shiver down her arms, but fury simmered just beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, tears slid down Elissa&#39;s cheeks.&#34;Kenzie and I have always been friends. I never imagined she&#39;d say these things about me behind my back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her attention back to Kenzie, she said,sounding hurt, &#34;If there was a problem, Kenzie,you could have talked to me instead of trying to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ruin my reputation in front of everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Zoe blurted out, &#34;Kenzie,you owe everyone an explanation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie could feel every stare drilling into her,making her want to disappear. The way Zoe looked at her said everything. The crowd&#39;s faces,twisted in judgment, didn&#39;t help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s glare was sharper than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any confession would end her place in this industry. Staying silent, though, would make her Elissa&#39;s next target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Arabella lounged back in her chair,eager to see how Kenzie would handle this disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words failed her as Kenzie stammered, &#34;I-l...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had she started, Zoe interjected,&#34;Elissa&#39;s never been that kind of girl. You&#39;ve really crossed the line this time, Kenzie. Picking on her like that is just cruel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie trembled. The urge to defend herself was strong, yet every pair of eyes in the room made it clear nobody would take her side. Eventually, she whispered, &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I was just jealous of Elissa.That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chin dropped as she stared at the floor,weighed down by a sense of deep unfairness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock rippled through the crowd in a wave of startled murmurs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>川 can＇t believe people in college would go this far,&#34; someone blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way Elissa had to steal from anyone. She&#39;s a natural,&#34; another voice insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenzie is just pathetic, always sticking to Elissa like a shadow, and now she&#39;s trying to ruin her,&#34; a third added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fingers curling into fists, Kenzie pressed her nails deep into her skin, trying not to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the other side, Elissa spoke in a gentle,almost sorrowful tone. &#34;I never thought Kenzie would do something like this. Still, I need to take some responsibility. I should&#39;ve noticed she wasn&#39;t herself lately. If I had paid more attention as her friend, maybe things wouldn&#39;t have turned out this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room immediately softened, and sympathy shifted in Elissa&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella rolled her eyes. Elissa was always clever at turning the tide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile played on Zoe&#39;s lips. All along, she trusted Elissa&#39;s character and believed there was no way she would resort to copying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden shout sliced through the crowd. &#34;That dance didn&#39;t belong to your friend at all-it&#39;s Isabella&#39;s! Anyone can see Elissa&#39;s routine matches a video Isabella uploaded a while back.She deleted it soon after, maybe because she thought it wasn&#39;t good enough. Lucky for me,l downloaded it-I&#39;m lsabella&#39;s biggest fan, after all!&#34;</p>
