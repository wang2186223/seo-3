                <p>This was the deal Arabella and Joyce had made -Arabella would help her get revenge, and in exchange, Joyce would hand over the old video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, as everything unfolded, Joyce understood that even if she backed out,Arabella would still find a way to get her hands on that footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps echoed through the room. Everyone was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the back, Daisy sat still, her face composed as she watched Joyce offer her apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forgiveness wasn&#39;t on her mind. And it certainly wasn&#39;t on Arabella&#39;s either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella shifted her gaze to Elissa and Kenny.&#34;So, are you both still refusing to apologize?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s fury boiled over as she lunged toward her. &#34;You&#39;re the reason Joyce turned against me! You tore us apart!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could get close, Joyce stepped in and slapped her hard across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was full of disgust. &#34;Still playing the victim, Elissa? Was she the one who made you sleep with my boyfriend too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa froze. Hearing that kind of anger in Joyce&#39;s voice sent a wave of panic through her.&#34;Joyce,l...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce wasn&#39;t done. Her words were calm,each one cutting deep. &#34;You&#39;re going to pay for every disgusting thing you did. I&#39;ll make sure of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s head spun. Her vision blurred, and she nearly collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny quickly caught Joyce&#39;s hand, trying to stop her. &#34;Come on, Joyce, the three of us-we&#39;ve been best friends for years. You&#39;re really</p>
                
                
                
                <p>going to side with someone like Arabella over us? It&#39;s not what you think. I&#39;ll explain everything later!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stared at Kenny, her eyes full of bitter disappointment. Even now, he still thought he could smooth-talk his way out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yanked her hand away and snapped, &#34;Get lost, Kenny! If you still want a shred of dignity,go apologize to Daisy right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny&#39;s face turned grim. Apologize to Daisy?Seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa wasn&#39;t backing down either. She suddenly laughed, her voice sharp. &#34;You&#39;re unbelievable, Arabella. But if you think this is enough to make us give in, dream on. We didn&#39;t do anything wrong. You and Daisy are the problem!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept spouting denials, even with no escape in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd erupted in anger. &#34;Elissa, just ----)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>apologize already! You&#39;re the one who started all this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bitch! If you don&#39;t say sorry, don&#39;t even think about walking out of here unharmed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m done supporting Tucker Group and Hyde Group. These rich people think they can crush everyone beneath them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The uproar was so loud that even the voices of the people Elissa had paid off were lost in the noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But despite the chaos and backlash, neither Elissa nor Kenny looked the least bit sorry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To them, apologizing meant admitting guilt. As long as they held out, there was still a slim hope they could spin things in their favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve had enough of this circus!&#34; Elissa snapped,dropping her mask and turning to storm off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny followed closely behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, just as they neared the exit, two men</p>
                
                
                
                <p>stepped into their path-Bennie and Hayden,both clearly fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Hayden stormed up and landed a punch right across Kenny&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little brat!&#34; he barked. &#34;How many times did I tell you to treat Joyce right? And now you&#39;ve gone and betrayed her? You ruined that girl&#39;s name!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still seething, he grabbed Kenny by the back of the head and shoved him forward, forcing him into a bow. &#34;Apologize, you idiot!&#34; he shouted,making sure the entire crowd heard him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain was sharp, but what stung more was the public humiliation-Kenny&#39;s eyes brimmed with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to hold out, but Hayden leaned in and hissed, &#34;If you don&#39;t apologize now, we&#39;ll lose everything. Do you really want to drag the whole company down with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made Kenny&#39;s blood run cold. His father</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wouldn&#39;t lie about something like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just who was Arabella,really?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I lied. Daisy never came on to me.I liked how she looked and tried to approach her,but she turned me down. Out of spite, I spread false rumors,&#34; Kenny said, clenching his fists and squeezing his eyes shut as he forced the words out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The response, both in the room and across the livestream, was instant and furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spreading lies about a girl like that? Pure evil!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If her sister hadn&#39;t stepped up, Daisy&#39;s entire future could&#39;ve been destroyed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is unforgivable. Hyde Group-you&#39;ve lost me for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden glanced at Arabella. When she gave.a subtle nod, he turned back to the crowd. &#34;This is my fault as a parent. I&#39;ll ensure the victim receives proper compensation; and Kenny will</p>
                
                
                
                <p>be disciplined accordingly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, he dragged Kenny out of the venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa stood frozen in disbelief. Had Hayden really lost it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, Bennie stepped beside her and said urgently, &#34;Elissa, apologize. Right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, what? Why should l? Once I apologize,there&#39;s no way to undo it!&#34; Elissa cried out, her voice trembling with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t, we&#39;ll be bankrupt in less than an hour!&#34; Bennie hissed, his teeth clenched. &#34;The Gordon family is involved now!&#34;</p>
