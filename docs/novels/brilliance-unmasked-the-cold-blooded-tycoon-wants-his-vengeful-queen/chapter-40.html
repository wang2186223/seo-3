                <p>Rage erupted among the students as they closed in around Elissa, voices rising in accusation. &#34;How could you do something so heartless,Elissa? I can&#39;t believe I was a real big fan of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran through Joyce as her eyes darted from the damning posts to Elissa&#39;s stricken face. Step by step, she retreated, voice trembling. &#34;So you&#39;re the one who misled me into believing Daisy had feelings for my boyfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was seething when she saw the post and wanted to face Daisy, but Elissa held her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that instant, she began to despise Daisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she never guessed that Elissa had been pulling the strings all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was too much. Joyce spun on her heel and fled the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed and shamed, Elissa stared at the floor, refusing to meet anyone&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaitlyn, guilt heavy in her tone, addressed Arabella. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. We&#39;ve judged you so unfairly for so long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her apology opened the floodgates. &#34;We&#39;re sorry, Daisy,&#34; others echoed, regret etched on their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always thought you were sweet and beautiful.What Elissa did toyou was just cruel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella surveyed the crowd, eyes lingering on the remorseful faces, then turned wordlessly and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell, replaced by unease. &#34;Will Daisy ever forgive us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration boiled over as another voice interjected. &#34;Damn vou. Elissa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tempers snapped-a hand flew, landing a sharp slap across Elissa&#39;s cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain seared through Elissa&#39;s cheek as she pressed a trembling hand to her face,stammering out excuses that felI on deaf ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgust and betrayal radiated from every direction, her classmates glaring at her with open contempt. Her body shook as tears poured down, completely beyond her control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the admiration she had spent years cultivating was swept away in a single morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing about this outcome made sense-how had everything unraveled so quickly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, the university president stepped in,deciding she had faced enough. &#34;That&#39;s enough. Let&#39;s all settle down and return to your classrooms. Focus on your studies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the president&#39;s firm tone, the gathering broke up and students drifted away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella made her way back to her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she settled in, she noticed a growing pile of small gifts and handwritten notes on her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One message stood out. &#34;We&#39;re so sorry, Daisy.We let ourselves be misled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another muttered, &#34;Forgive me-l should&#39;ve intervened when Elissa bullied you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other voices chimed in, &#34;You&#39;ve always been incredible. Watching you suffer while | stayed silent filled me with regret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One apology after another landed in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Arabella gave no sign of acknowledgment.She kept her focus on the book in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when someone slid into the seat beside her did she pause. &#34;Once she knows the real story, I bet she&#39;ll feel a lot less alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaitlyn&#39;s words carried real sincerity. Arabella&#39;s eyes narrowed thoughtfully before she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>answered in a calm, even tone, &#34;So you&#39;ve known the truth this entire time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s correct. While Daisy resembles you,she&#39;s never quite matched your presence,&#34;Kaitlyn murmured, sorrow shadowing her gaze.&#34;She was always gentle and tender-hearted-nothing like the way you carry yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Arabella paused, reassessing Kaitlyn with new respect. For someone so outwardly soft-spoken, her perception cut deep. Not even Elissa had seen past her facade,yet Kaitlyn had sensed the truth from the very beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long absence, Joyce finally slipped into the room. The moment her eyes landed on Arabella, a storm of emotions flickered across her face, but instead of approaching,she retreated to a seat at the farthest edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s desk, by contrast, remained empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silent tension lingered as classmates kept</p>
                
                
                
                <p>darting glances between Joyce and Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had been Arabella&#39;s harshest tormentor.Now that she knew the truth, what would she do next?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the lesson was drawing to a close, a new figure appeared in the doorway,catching the attention of everyone in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that Kenny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He must be looking for Joyce. Kenny hasn&#39;t changed a bit-still turning heads wherever he goes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s eyes slid toward the door, her expression hardening. That was a face she could never forget-a face she had mentally blacklisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaitlyn, noticing the shift, leaned in and explained, &#34;That&#39;s Kenny Hyde, Joyce&#39;s boyfriend. They&#39;re known across campus as the golden couple-wealthy backgrounds, admired by everyone. There were even rumors Daisy had</p>
                
                
                
                <p>tried to catch his eye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold smirk touched Arabella&#39;s lips. &#34;That one?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He is not worthy of my sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement flickered in Joyce&#39;s expression the moment she spotted Kenny waiting by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bell barely finished ringing before she hurried over, calling out with barely concealed joy,&#34;Kenny!&#34;</p>
