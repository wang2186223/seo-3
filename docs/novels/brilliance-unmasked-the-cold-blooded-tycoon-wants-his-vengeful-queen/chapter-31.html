                <p>A skeptical look crossed Elissa&#39;s face. &#34;Can you actually prove it? Arabella and Daisy are twins,after all-same faces, matching DNA!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grudging acceptance colored Khloe&#39;s reply.&#34;Never mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to make a call.&#34; Without another word,Elissa rose from her seat and headed out to the balcony, pulling out her phone to call Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elissa.&#34; Joyce&#39;s greeting came heavy with exhaustion,her voice lacking its usual spark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concern flickered in Elissa&#39;s eyes. &#34;What&#39;s happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears shimmered in Joyce&#39;s gaze. &#34;It&#39;s my mom.She&#39;s not well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alarm replaced concern as Elissa pressed for</p>
                
                
                
                <p>answers. &#34;How did that happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A memory flashed through Joyce&#39;s mind-the men in black bursting through the door, their identities still a mystery, though they almost certainly had it out for the Lambert family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t bring herself to tell Elissa the truth,so she kept it vague. &#34;Just an accident. Nothing you need to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting gears,Elissa lowered her voice. &#34;I need you to know something important.&#34; She explained how Arabella had shown up at school,passing herself off as Daisy and seeking revenge. &#34;She&#39;s at our school because of Daisy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization lit up Joyce&#39;s expression. &#34;So that explains the change in her. She&#39;s acting like someone else entirely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger sharpened her tone. &#34;Both those women -leeching off your family and still daring to cause trouble? I promise, Elissa, I won&#39;t let her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>set foot in school again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hatred burned fiercely within Joyce, her anger toward Arabella reaching its height.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa spoke in a gentle tone. &#34;Alright, Joyce.Just don&#39;t go too far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a theatrical sigh, Joyce replied, &#34;Honestly,you&#39;re too soft. What would you ever do without someone like me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet smile lingered on Elissa&#39;s lips after the call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Handling situations would have been far more complicated without someone as reckless as Joyce around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, rain kept tapping steadily against the windowpanes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning to the villa, Arabella headed straight for a steaming shower, letting the warmth chase away the lingering chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, a gentle knock sounded at her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Answering, Arabella found the butler waiting with a glass in hand. &#34;Miss Stanley, I saw how soaked you were. Please have some warm milk so you don&#39;t catch a cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grateful nod accompanied her response.&#34;Thank you. Tell me, how many bodyguards do you have available?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reassurance came swiftly from the butler.&#34;However many you require, Miss Stanley. And if that isn&#39;t enough, Mr. Gordon can authorize the elite security unit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those so-called elite guards-death warriors-demanded enormous investment to prepare for duty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bodyguards weren&#39;t needed for the moment, so Arabella left instructions for the butler to keep watch over the villa while she went to Daisy&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steady presence at her side, the butler</p>
                
                
                
                <p>accompanied her on the walk. &#34;The doctor made his rounds today. Your sister&#39;s condition keeps improving. There&#39;s little cause for concern. Security here is top-notch. It&#39;s impossible for outsiders to cross.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing around, Arabella nodded thoughtfully.&#34;The setting is truly first-rate. But tell me-where does Asher stay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet explanation followed. &#34;This was once Mr. Gordon&#39;s residence,&#34; the butler replied.&#34;Most likely, he&#39;s staying at his office these days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This information caught Arabella off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as she looked over the tasteful furnishings and subtle elegance, she had to admit the space reflected Asher&#39;s personal style.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knowing smile spread across the butler&#39;s face. &#34;He thinks the world of you, Miss Stanley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words left Arabella quiet, unable to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following her time with Daisy, Arabella retreated to her room and dialed Asher&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rich, compelling voice answered on the other end.&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The deep timbre was unmistakable-Asher himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a boldness she didn&#39;t entirely intend,Arabella asked, &#34;Are you coming back to stay with me tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy pause filled the space between them,thick with unspoken words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching herself, Arabella realized how her question might have sounded and opened her mouth to clarify, but Asher spoke first, his voice quiet and steady. &#34;You know I&#39;m only doing this because my father wanted me to watch over you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a slow, steadying breath, Arabella explained, &#34;What I meant is, you could use this place too. Once Daisy&#39;s better, we&#39;ll move out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleeping at your office can&#39;t be good for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brushing off her offer, Asher kept his tone distant. &#34;That&#39;s not necessary. Make yourself comfortable there. I&#39;ll drop by if I need to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Arabella answered, then ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a nagging suspicion in Arabella&#39;s mind that Asher had chosen his words on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance simmered within her; he had a knack for getting under her skin lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, a small voice inside wondered if she was reading too much into every interaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that very moment, far across town, Asher lounged in his spacious office, his posture one of lazy confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing him, Dominick caught a fleeting hint of a smile breaking through Asher&#39;s typically stoic features,and for a second, questioned whether</p>
                
                
                
                <p>his imagination was running wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick asked, &#34;Was that Miss Stanley on the line,Mr.Gordon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without much interest, Asher gave a simple nod in response.&#34;Mm-hmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No words followed from Dominick&#39;s end; he kept his thoughts to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything about Asher lately hinted at a shift-he wasn&#39;t quite the same as before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick&#39;s curiosity bubbled to the surface.&#34;Does this mean we need to keep closer tabs on her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a look of practiced detachment, Asher replied, &#34;Like I said-just watch for anything significant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick knew he didn&#39;t mean what he said,but he still played along. &#34;Understood. I was about to show you something regarding her at school, but it wasn&#39;t urgent. Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>handle it from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of intensity appeared in Asher&#39;s eyes.</p>
