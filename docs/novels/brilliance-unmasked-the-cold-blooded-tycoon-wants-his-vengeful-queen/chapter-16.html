                <p>Daisy was asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Arabella didn&#39;t need words-she knew if Daisy were conscious, she would be thrilled.Watching those bullies finally squirm would have made her day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this? This was just the teaser. The real show hadn&#39;t even started yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella pulled out her phone and jumped onto the campus forum, curious to see if the drama had hit the rumor mill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did anyone catch what happened to Joyce? She got totally destroyed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw the whole thing! Bet she won&#39;t be showing her face anytime soon. Not gonna lie, it&#39;s kinda satisfying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She deserved it. But who did it? I need to know!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pretty sure Daisy walked out right after. Could it have been her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce probably shoved Daisy down the stairs back then. Now Daisy&#39;s back, and she&#39;s like some</p>
                
                
                
                <p>kind of tough avenger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The students were loving the chaos, typing away like crazy. Being anonymous made it easy to say whatever they wanted without worrying who would find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then Arabella saw something that made her pause-a name she knew way too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Kenzie, of all people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl used to trail after Elissa like a shadow and had helped make Daisy&#39;s life miserable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella tapped on her profile to snoop a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turned out, Kenzie had flipped. She was busy dragging Elissa all over the forum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elissa&#39;s got nothing going for her. She copies my work and thinks she can buy my silence with a thousand bucks?Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of Elissa&#39;s followers shot back, &#34;You serious?Show some proof.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie wasn&#39;t having it. &#34;I don&#39;t need to prove anything to you.Keep falling for her fake smile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella kept scrolling, and her eyes narrowed when she came across a private video Kenzie had uploaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a dance performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie had captioned it. &#34;This was my original work. You all keep falling for Elissa&#39;s act. She&#39;s just a smooth-talking poser!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella raised an eyebrow. &#34;Wow, she turned on Elissa faster than I expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched the whole thing, a slow smirk creeping up. This was too perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Joyce was a no-show on campus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella ditched her classes that day and made her way to the Griridge Troupe&#39;s practice session.After rehearsals, she dropped by the Dance Association&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Jennifer Dawson, the vice president, was busy flipping through paperwork, and when she heard someone knock on the door, she called out,clearly irritated, &#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment she looked up and saw Arabella,her expression changed completely. Her jaw nearly hit the floor. &#34;Oh my gosh...Isabella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a calm, knowing smile. &#34;Surprised?Thought I&#39;d drop by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on-you&#39;re still a student?&#34; Jennifer blinked, clearly caught off guard. &#34;The president said you were filling in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yep,just helping out for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what? I&#39;m naming you captain on the spot,&#34; Jennifer said, looking almost too thrilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a calm shrug, her tone flat.&#34;Appreciate it, but I&#39;d rather go through the regular channels. Also, I&#39;m using Daisy Stanley here, so let&#39;s keep it that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer looked confused for a second but nodded anyway. &#34;Alright, noted. Let me know if you need anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will do.&#34; Arabella gave a polite nod and walked out without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Zoe strolled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning! I brought you something to eat,&#34;she said, grinning sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer didn&#39;t react much at first but then raised a brow. &#34;Zoe, you&#39;re one of the instructors at the university,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure I am. Why?&#34; Zoe replied, curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer&#39;s tone turned pointed. &#34;You&#39;ve got</p>
                
                
                
                <p>someone special in your batch. Don&#39;t let her slip through the cracks-she&#39;s worth watching.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoe&#39;s face lit up. &#34;Of course. I&#39;ve got my eye on her-she&#39;s going to steal the spotlight at the next show,&#34; she said smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over in the rehearsal space, the fill-ins were pushing hard, trying to nail their moves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for Arabella, it was child&#39;s play-she was dancing to her own blueprint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When break time rolled around, the dancers grabbed water and noticed Elissa soaking up the spotlight, chatting with the core team like a celebrity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elissa, that move earlier? So smooth! Mind showing us again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa grinned confidently. &#34;Sure thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jumped right into her freestyle, not missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her moves were sharp and full of flair, and the crowd ate it up, cheering and applauding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s legit. I haven&#39;t seen anyone with that kind of range in ages.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like the new generation&#39;s here to rule!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Zoe walked up with an easy smile.&#34;Elissa, you&#39;re getting noticed! Ms. Dawson couldn&#39;t stop praising you-keep it up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s face lit up. &#34;Wait, seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer wasn&#39;t just any official. She was one of Scainia&#39;s elite dancers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So getting her nod meant a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the dancers couldn&#39;t help but watch her with a mix of awe and envy-it was like Elissa just leveled up in front of everyone.</p>
