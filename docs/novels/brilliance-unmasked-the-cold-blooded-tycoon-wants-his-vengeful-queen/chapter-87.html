                <p>Arabella bit her lip. &#34;Are you saying I&#39;m the one you love?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; Asher replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;|...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could even get another word out,Asher gently covered her mouth. &#34;| know you haven&#39;t really thought about this yet. And I&#39;m not going to rush you. Just take your time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella looked down. &#34;What if I never figure it out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then that only means I haven&#39;t done enough to make you feel loved,&#34; he said honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart skipped a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a long time since someone made her feel this accepted-without pressure, without expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, out of nowhere, Asher&#39;s tone turned cold.&#34;Put those things back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella pouted but nodded obediently. As they</p>
                
                
                
                <p>opened the door, they found Daisy standing right outside, clearly having been eavesdropping.She looked a little embarrassed. &#34;So, are you two done talking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a small smile. &#34;Yeah, we&#39;re done.Come on, Daisy, let&#39;s unpack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher leaned against the doorframe, his gaze fixed on Daisy. &#34;No one could ever take Arabella&#39;s place in my heart. You don&#39;t need to worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy didn&#39;t look happy about it, but after Rosie&#39;s public clarification, she was starting to think maybe it had all been a misunderstanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not giving you endless chances,&#34; she said coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t need more than one,&#34; Asher replied calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up their suitcases and carried them back upstairs, placing each one in the correct room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Arabella received a message from Joshua. &#34;The chefs Mr. Gordon sent over are amazing! I just tasted one of the dishes, and it&#39;s incredible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella blinked in surprise but felt a little thrill</p>
                
                
                
                <p>inside. She glanced at Asher, who was standing nearby, casually leaning against the wall with his usual effortless charm and a faint smile playing on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m heading over now,&#34; she said aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll drive you,&#34; Asher offered immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella looked at him for a second but didn&#39;t say no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the restaurant, Joshua was a bit taken aback when he saw Arabella walk in with Asher, but he quickly led her to the kitchen to taste the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Arabella was focused on tasting, he leaned closer and muttered, &#34;Why does it seem like Asher has way too much free time lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella raised an eyebrow in amusement.&#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t he a CEO? But somehow, wherever you go,he magically appears too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella glanced through the kitchen window and saw Asher quietly working on his laptop from the couch. He wasn&#39;t slacking-he was simply making time to be by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The flavor&#39;s solid,&#34; she said, dodging Joshua&#39;s remark. &#34;But the seasoning still needs a little tweaking...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She threw herself into the task, adjusting spice after spice until the sky began to brighten. After countless tries, she finally got the first dish just right. With that breakthrough, things moved quicker, and they finished the rest in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Arabella finally stepped out of the kitchen,it was already seven in the morning. Asher was still on the sofa, focused on his laptop. When he looked up and saw her, he set it aside and said softly,&#34;Come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked over and sat beside him. Asher reached out, slipping an arm around her waist.&#34;Are you tired?&#34; he asked softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; she replied simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had pulled plenty of all-nighters in her life, so this wasn&#39;t anything new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher looked at her seriously, lowering his head a little. &#34;From now on, try to get things done during the day. Let the team handle the rest. You don&#39;t need to do everything yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; she murmured in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, all of a sudden, Arabella glanced toward the window, and her eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher followed her gaze and noticed it too-Rosie and Bob were clearly cut from the same cloth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Want me to send them away?&#34; Asher asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a half-smile. &#34;There&#39;s nothing for them to see from out there. Once the place officially opens, people-watching will be normal.If Bob&#39;s getting nervous, it just means we&#39;re doing something right. He&#39;s scared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s head home then.&#34; Asher took her hand naturally, as if it was the most ordinary thing in the world, then stood and led her toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella looked down at their linked fingers,quietly puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since when did he start doing this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua followed them out and nearly did a double take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t Arabella said there was no chance with Asher? Then how did things get to this point?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the ride back, Arabella felt a little drowsy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The city was starting to come alive, with office</p>
                
                
                
                <p>workers rushing to start their day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they drove past the Lambert Group building,she glanced out the window and suddenly spotted two familiar faces-Joyce and Kenny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She narrowed her eyes for a moment, then shut them again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their downfall was already written, and Arabella knew she didn&#39;t have to get invoIved. Sooner or later, they would be buried in debt on their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company was in bad shape, which was why Joyce had stepped in to try and save it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, what she didn&#39;t expect was for Kenny to show up too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, please,&#34; Kenny begged, grabbing her arm.&#34;Things are tough for both of us. If we announce our engagement, it&#39;ll give the stock price a boost!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at her with eyes brimming with hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce tilted her head slightly, acting like she was actually thinking it over. &#34;Hmm... sounds like a tempting offer,&#34; she said slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he heard that, Kenny&#39;s face lit up right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, he believed Joyce still loved him enough to overlook everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, she was nothing more than a naive girl he could keep stringing along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce gave him a cold, mocking smile. &#34;And then people can say, &#39;Look, there go the two bullies back at it again.&#39; Perfect,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny&#39;s face stiffened for a second. But he quickly covered it up. &#34;There&#39;s no need to speak like that,&#34; he said gently. &#34;I really believe that as long as we&#39;re together, we can turn everything around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Hyde Group was basically falling apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Lambert Group still had a little time left,so Kenny knew he had no choice now.Joyce was his only shot at salvaging what was left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce&#39;s face turned icy. She yanked her arm out of his grip and stared at him with pure disgust. &#34;Are you serious right now? You slept with Elissa behind my back, and you still think I&#39;ll ever forgive you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not true, Joyce! Arabella&#39;s the one lying to you!&#34; Kenny argued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce looked at him, the man she had once loved,and felt nothing but revulsion. &#34;You make me sick,Kenny. I was right outside that hospital room when you were sleeping with Elissa.&#34;</p>
