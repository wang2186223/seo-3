                <p>Jeffrey let out a laugh. &#34;Okay, okay, I get the picture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he ended the call, a jolt of excitement buzzed through him. &#34;I just heard from Mr.Powell. He&#39;s the CEO&#39;s right-hand man at Vanguard Group. They want to invest in us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way!&#34; The group could hardly believe it.Vanguard Group completely outclassed Trace&#39;s firm by miles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashing a grin, Jeffrey confirmed, &#34;It&#39;s absolutely legit, and we owe this one to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced over at Arabella before he continued, &#34;Daisy. Turns out, Mr. Powell said Daisy once did their CEO a favor, and now they&#39;re convinced our troupe is truly something special.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence swept through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Karlie couldn&#39;t hide her delight as she gazed at Arabella. &#34;Daisy, you&#39;re incredible! You just</p>
                
                
                
                <p>saved all of us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, she just got lucky.&#34; Lailah chimed in as a wave of jealousy and resentment washed over her. How did a backup dancer end up holding this much power over everyone? &#34;Let&#39;s not forget, I was the one who introduced Mr.Burke, and he&#39;s been our biggest supporter for years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And thanks to your efforts, Lailah, every one of us faced sexual harassment,&#34; Arabella answered, her voice was cool and unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her statement got right to the point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew Trace had crossed the line with more than a few of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah&#39;s cheeks went pale. &#34;That&#39;s outrageous!What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she finished speaking, her phone buzzed.She read the message,her expression tightening,and quickly got up to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella wasn&#39;t the least bit surprised as Lailah stormed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slid into the seat next to Karlie,who looked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>at her with a mix of admiration and envy. &#34;Daisy,we all owe you for what you did. Honestly, Mr.Burke made me so uncomfortable-I hated it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel the same.&#34; A backup dancer spoke up next, her voice quiet but steady. &#34;He tried the same thing with me. His position made it impossible to say anything, but I couldn&#39;t stand it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another chimed in, echoing their frustration,&#34;I still don&#39;t understand how Lailah convinced him to invest in us. Honestly, there were moments l wanted to quit the troupe for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, everyone started voicing their complaints.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear the entire group had grown weary of Trace&#39;s actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, just outside the room, Lailah&#39;s face twisted with anger as she whispered into her phone. &#34;You still haven&#39;t found out who sent that tip?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice replied, &#34;No, but I&#39;ve managed to keep things quiet for now. Be more cautious next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34; Lailah ended the call,though anxiety still lingered in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone had actually reported her relationship with Trace to the Dance Association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank goodness her friend there had helped smooth things over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she couldn&#39;t shake the question. Who would dare turn her in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Agitated, Lailah approached the door and overheard everyone inside, their voices full of resentment toward Trace. Her mood darkened even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she never secured Trace&#39;s investment,would the troupe have made it this far?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single one of them seemed grateful for her efforts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furious, Lailah stomped her foot, made up her mind not to return, and marched away without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That marked the end of the dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, the group dispersed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella decided to head back to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone buzzed with a call from Joshua. &#34;Have you already handled things with Mr. Burke? I was about to step in myself, bout suddenly, his company&#39;s facing a setback.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella shook her head, confused. &#34;I didn&#39;t do anything. Maybe karma finally caught up with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua replied thoughtfully,&#34;Yeah, maybe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she got back to the hospital, Arabella couldn&#39;t help but look into Trace&#39;s company.To her surprise, it was facing attacks from every direction. Her eyes narrowed. This didn&#39;t look like a simple setback. Someone clearly wanted to see him wiped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the Burke Group wasn&#39;t one of the industry giants, it had been around for years.Only a real heavyweight could take it down so fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Arabella thought over the situation,someone walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella glanced up and recognized Asher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in an all-black suit and carrying an air as cold as midnight, he seemed almost unapproachable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take Arabella long to put the pieces together. &#34;You&#39;re the one who went after the Burke Group, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher looked genuinely taken aback, his gaze lingering on Arabella. &#34;You catch on quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella shrugged. &#34;It&#39;s not about being clever.Only someone with your resources could&#39;ve managed something likethis. But what do you have against the Burke Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cold edge to his voice, Asher responded,&#34;Dominick said Trace Burke tried something with you.Is that true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes searched Arabella for any sign of physical injury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m all right,&#34; Arabella assured him,though her feelings were mixed. &#34;I appreciate what you did,but I&#39;m not someone who needs rescuing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher had to be tied up with work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella didn&#39;t want to be a burden, especially since there was no real bond between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s expression grew thoughtful for a moment.Then he replied, &#34;It didn&#39;t take much.Besides, I heard a company is already planning to invest in your troupe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella nodded. &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Asher turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on.&#34; Arabella moved quickly to catch up.&#34;I&#39;ll walk you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher accepted her offer without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked, Arabella finally asked the question that had been weighing on her.&#34;Would you mind telling me about your father and mine?&#34;</p>
