                <p>&#34;Daisy really puts on a show-she acts all sweet, but there&#39;s something cold about her underneath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, even if Elissa did copy someone&#39;s work, I still think she&#39;s a good person at heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t the school just expel Daisy already? It&#39;s exhausting sharing a classroom with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around Elissa, classmates clustered close,offering reassurance and encouragement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elissa, you should bring your case to the Dance Association. They&#39;ll get justice for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steady resolve shone in Elissa&#39;s eyes as she nodded. &#34;I will. Thank you all so much. Without your support, I&#39;m not sure I would have made it this far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to stick it out, Elissa. We&#39;re behind</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you all the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a grateful smile, Elissa responded,&#34;Thanks, everyone. You&#39;re amazing. Lunch is on me at the cafeteria-let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cheers erupted. &#34;You&#39;re the greatest, Elissa! We love you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t wait to tell my friends how lucky I am to have a classmate like you,&#34; another classmate exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement buzzed through the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Joyce prepared to spit out her gum,Elissa offered her a tissue. &#34;Joyce, use this-don&#39;t litter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Complying, Joyce spat the gum onto the tissue, which Elissa promptly took from her.Together, the whole group exited the classroom,laughter echoing behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On their way past Arabella&#39;s desk, a commotion broke out-Elissa appeared to stumble, and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>suddenly the gum slipped from her hand,landing right in Arabella&#39;s hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning regret, Elissa fumbled for a tissue.&#34;Oops, sorry about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every attempt to help only tangled more hair in the sticky mess, her touch anything but gentle,leaving Arabella&#39;s scalp smarting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting up straight, Arabella fixed Elissa with a steady look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a sweet voice, Elissa added, &#34;Daisy, I&#39;m really sorry. I swear it wasn&#39;t intentional.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, satisfied smile tugged at the corners of her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did that on purpose. If Arabella wanted retribution,she ought to understand what Daisy had endured first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp scream tore through the classroom,drawing every eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of shrinking away, Arabella yanked the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>gum free from her own hair and smashed it into Elissa&#39;s, ripping away a handful of strands with a swift motion. Tears sprang to Elissa&#39;s eyes as she cried out, &#34;Stop! That hurts!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic swept the room; students hurried over,trying to pull the two apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cries of protest filled the air. &#34;Daisy, let go of her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accusations flew as someone scolded, &#34;How could you be so cruel? You&#39;re in her family&#39;s debt. The least you could do is treat her with respect!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp tug freed the gum from Elissa&#39;s hair, but Arabella&#39;s forceful pull brought a clump of hair with it. Elissa&#39;s shriek echoed through the room as she dropped to her knees, clutching her head. Her fingers came away stained with blood, and dizziness swept over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning next to the classmate who had spoken out, Arabella pressed the sticky wad hard onto</p>
                
                
                
                <p>his scalp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch! It hurts!&#34; the boy shouted in pain, tears springing to his eyes. Rage surged, and he lunged at Arabella-only to receive a stinging slap that split his lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leveling a cold gaze at the room, Arabella spoke up. &#34;You call yourselves defenders of justice? Siding with the bullies just makes you the same as them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she strode away, leaving chaos in her wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shocked silence filled the room for several heartbeats before anyone rushed to help Elissa and the boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa, voice trembling, said, &#34;This is all because of me. I shouldn&#39;t have involved everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediate comfort came from the others.&#34;Don&#39;t blame yourself, Elissa. Daisy was out of line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Touching the blood on his scalp, the boy trembled with fury. &#34;I&#39;m going straight to the administration. Daisy needs to be expelled for this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grief welled up as Elissa looked at the hair on the floor, but a cold satisfaction replaced it when she imagined Arabella&#39;s fate. &#34;Go ahead,Arabella. That little outburst is about to cost you everything,&#34; she pondered, lips curving in a wintry smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within two hours, hashtags like #DaisyBulliedElissa,#GriridgeUniversityBullyingCase, and #UngratefulDaisy were dominating the trending lists online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Prestige and honor surrounded Griridge University, the crown jewel of local education,but now a scandal had shattered its calm-allegations of bullying had everyone talking.In the midst of the uproar, Arabella received a summons to the university president&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle tone colored the president&#39;s words as he addressed her. &#34;Miss Stanley, can you tell me what took place? Mr. Gordon has already brought your situation to my attention. I&#39;d like you to be honest with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steady confidence marked Arabella&#39;s reply.&#34;Please don&#39;t trouble yourself, sir. I&#39;ll have this situation sorted out by next week.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she looked barely older than a student,Arabella radiated a calm authority that made the president unconsciously nod in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the meeting over, Arabella headed back to the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saturday arrived, bringing a day free from classes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Freed from their studies, even more people tuned in, eager to see the latest twist in the controversy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s name was now infamous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everywhere online, angry voices filled the comment sections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Elissa&#39;s Twitter exploded-her follower count shot up by five hundred thousand in a single day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By Sunday morning, Elissa had returned home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting at the breakfast table, Khloe scrolled through Elissa&#39;s profile, unable to hide her envy.&#34;You&#39;re amazing, Elissa! Your followers just keep coming. You&#39;ve already passed two million!&#34;</p>
