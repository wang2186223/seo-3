                <p>Elissa found herself speechless, not knowing how to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did Arabella know the sachet?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even that short pause said enough, and the disappointment from the crowd was immediate and unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How disgusting! So Elissa was responsible all along!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But if Elissa had the sachet, why did she end up affected too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just think about it for a second. The homeless man was definitely drugged. The minute Elissa walked in, he probably stripped her, so she never got the chance to take out the sachet.Elissa only has herself to blame,&#34; Kaitlyn cut in,her tone cold as ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the students found that explanation believable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella glanced over at Kaitlyn in surprise. She had been trying to figure out a way to explain things, but Kaitlyn had taken care of it already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The president did not hesitate. &#34;Everyone out!Elissa, get dressed,&#34; he instructed firmly.&#34;And someone bring that homeless man to my office!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staff members quickly led the homeless man away, shutting the door so Elissa could change in private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little by little, the onlookers left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce left,feeling completely lost and defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She failed to notice that Kenny was equally in low spirits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you Daisy would never do something like that. I liked her from the start. She&#39;s had it so rough!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who could have guessed Elissa would turn out to be so manipulative? She&#39;s downright mean!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe Elissa will finally get expelled. Then we won&#39;t have to worry about her causing any more trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s so funny that Joyce got fooled by Elissa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People&#39;s harsh comments swirled around her,and gradually, Joyce snapped back to reality,unable to shake off the anger building inside.Without another word, she left the gym behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella quietly exited the gym with Asher at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher glanced over and asked, &#34;What are you planning to do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella responded, &#34;How does the school usually deal with this kind of thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His answer came quickly. &#34;A case like this leads straight to expulsion. The school also announces it to everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a nod. &#34;That&#39;s all I wanted to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A trace of worry flashed in Asher&#39;s eyes as he took a closer look at her. &#34;Are you really alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella met his eyes and paused for a moment.She realized she had not felt anyone&#39;s genuine concern since her parents passed away. &#34;I&#39;m alright,&#34; she replied quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief showed in his features. &#34;Glad to hear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Asher reached out and gently placed his large hand on top of he head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella stood there, startled, noticing how his palm nearly covered her whole head. Snapping back, she shook her head and said, &#34;Don&#39;t mess up my hair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The motion surprised Asher too, but when he noticed her ears turning pink, a smile started to form. &#34;You know, I went to this school too.You&#39;ve been so focused on avenge your sister that I bet you haven&#39;t had time to see the campus. How about I show you around a little?Afterward, we could head to the banquet together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella paused to think it over, then nodded.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Griridge University stretched out before them,with buses rolling along the main streets and rows of tall sycamores creating patches of shade. Even with the sun blazing, the coolness under the trees lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Few people were out and about. Most had gJone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to catch performances or join in on campus activities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, they wandered quietly. Arabella watched sunlight scatter through the leaves,casting moving patterns on the sidewalk. With every step, she felt a bit more at ease, surprised by the comfort it brought her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s skills as a tour guide left much to be desired. He pointed things out without flair.&#34;Those are the dorms. Over there&#39;s the library</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella admired the scenery as they made their way across campus. When they reached a grove of maples, she found herself drifting toward it, watching as the wind sent clusters of red leaves swirling through the air. The sight took her breath away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This place is beautiful.&#34; A soft smile appeared on her face, and her eyes seemed to brighten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher watched her quietly, a gentle look in his own eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed almost childlike, taking in the world with new eyes and an open sense of wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher pointed out the trees. &#34;This is the maple grove. People say it&#39;s one of the most famous spots at Griridge University,&#34; he said, his voice calm and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella continued to smile. &#34;I can see why. It really is gorgeous. I imagine everyone adores this place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher shook his head. &#34;It isn&#39;t just about the scenery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her curiosity was piqued. &#34;Is there another reason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A barely-there smile touched Asher&#39;s lips, and the seriousness in his eyes softened. &#34;Students say it&#39;s the best spot on campus for confessing feelings. Ninety-nine percent of the people who speak their hearts here end up with a yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that explains it.&#34; Arabella glanced around,clearly impressed. &#34;No wonder. It&#39;s so peaceful here,anyone would feel comfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at Asher, she watched the maple leaves drift down around him. The gentle light softened his sharp features, and his tall figure stood out in the cascade of leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella tilted her head, asking, &#34;Did you ever visit this place when you were a student?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes met hers. &#34;This is actually my first time here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That response caught Arabella off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher leaned in, and Arabella caught a whiff of cedar. His cool fingers gently brushed her nose,and she instinctively stepped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did she notice he was holding out a single maple leaf for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warm flush colored Arabella&#39;s cheeks.&#34;Thank you for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replied softly, &#34;No need to thank me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle silence hung between them. Arabella watched more leaves twirl to the ground and finally said, &#34;You must have been so popular at school. Did anyone ever confess their feelings to you?&#34;</p>
