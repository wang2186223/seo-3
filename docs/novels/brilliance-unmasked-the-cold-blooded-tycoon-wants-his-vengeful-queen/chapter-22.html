                <p>Asher looked over at Arabella, taking note of just how on guarded she was. He lowered his voice as he said, &#34;My father and yours met during their time in the military. They actually got along really well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what happened after that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really don&#39;t know,&#34; said Asher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella couldn&#39;t find any words to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pair stepped into the elevator. As soon as it started going down, Arabella&#39;s senses told her right away that something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, darkness swallowed the elevator,and everything stopped moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calmly,Arabella leaned her back against the wall and said, &#34;Looks like the elevator stopped working.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence felt heavy, and she could hear Asher&#39;s breathing turning ragged. She took a step closer,picking up on his labored breaths, and immediately realized that he struggled with tight spaces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping her voice steady, Arabella assured him,&#34;Don&#39;t worry. This isn&#39;t a big deal. Someone will get it fixed soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher made a soft sound to show he heard her,and quiet settled over them again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could still feeI his anxiety hanging in the air.After a brief pause, she broke the silence. &#34;Can you tell me how your dad died?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His answer came out cold. &#34;There were a lot of things left unfinished when he was in the military.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her response was gentle, carrying a touch of longing. &#34;I understand. The military seems to leave a lot of open wounds. My father went through the same thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words grew softer. &#34;He died so unexpectedly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence followed. Suddenly, his hand clamped around Arabella&#39;s wrist, and sharp pain shot up her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hold tightened, as if he was ready to crush every bone in her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening wasn&#39;t claustrophobia. It was something far more dangerous, an explosive disorder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So far, he had mahaged to keep i unuei but just barely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella reached over and placed her hand on his. The familiar scent drifted toward Asher once again. For reasons he couldn&#39;t explain, his emotions slowly settled, and the storm of anger inside him faded away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Repairs at the hospital happened quickly. What happened in the elevator was nothing more than a minor hiccup. A moment later, the lights in the elevator flickered back, and they soon reached the parking level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at Asher, Arabella saw that his face had returned to its usual calm, almost detached look.He let go of her hand with slow movements,and red marks stood out clearly on her slender wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He parted his lips, looking as if he was about to say something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Arabella tucked her hand into her pocket. &#34;How do you like the sachet I gave you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s good,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought crossed her mind, and she spoke up. &#34;I remembered something that might help you sleep even better. Next time, I&#39;ll bring it for you. Thank</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you for looking out for me these days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a word left Asher&#39;s mouth. He gave a quiet nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, Asher made his way to his car, while Arabella turned back toward the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he got behind the wheel, he picked up the sachet out of habit. The gentle fragrance filled the inside of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long time, Asher kept his eyes fixed on the small pouch in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella returned to the hospital room and saw the unconscious Daisy. Soon after, she let herself drift off to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few days went by with nothing but dance practice. Before long, it was time to head back to school for regular classes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning came, and Arabella arrived at Griridge University with a small thrill of excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Joyce came back to class after her absence. Her injuries had not fully healed, and her face was still bruised. The second she spotted Arabella, her piercing eyes locked onto her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air in the classroom felt heavy, and everyone kept their voices low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During lunchtime, Joyce and her group cornered Arabella against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her arms folded, Arabella leaned back and met Joyce&#39;s stare with a faint, mysterious smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what can I do for you?&#34; Arabella asked in a tone much softer than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce fixed her stare on Arabella. There was no way she would risk going head-to-head with Daisy, and violence was out of the question.Instead, she looked stubborn. &#34;I&#39;ve still got dirt on you.Want to see what it is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold look flashed in Arabella&#39;s eyes. She already knew what Joyce meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the sudden shift in Arabella&#39;s expression,Joyce wavered for a second, but then her face brightened with excitement. &#34;Looks like you already figured it out. Here&#39;s the deal-this is your final shot. If you beg for my forgiveness and start doing what I say, I&#39;ll keep it to myself. How about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie interjected, &#34;Joyce is cutting you a break.You should really take it. Do you want everyone to see you naked online?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden burst of laughter escaped Arabella. &#34;Go ahead.Let everyone see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking back, Arabella walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Total disbelief washed over Joyce. &#34;Is she out of her mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie couldn&#39;t make sense of it either. Her nerves started to fray. &#34;Maybe she&#39;s calling our bluff. What if she thinks we&#39;re not serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let&#39;s post it right now,&#34; Joyce replied, her voice ice-cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting another moment, she uploaded the video of Daisy being stripped to the Internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the clip, she felt a bit of her anger from the recent fight melt away, and laughter bubbled up from her chest. Kenzie joined in, her laugh echoing Joyce&#39;s. &#34;She&#39;ll be at our feet soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Obviously,&#34; Joyce said, now feeling a wave of satisfaction. With a quick glance at Kenzie,she ordered, &#34;What are you waiting for? Go grab me some lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;You got it.&#34; She darted off toward the cafeteria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the crowded cafeteria, people gathered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>over their meals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around, Joyce could hear students whispering about the video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa... I never realized she looked that good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable! Has anyone told her she&#39;s gone viral?&#34;</p>
