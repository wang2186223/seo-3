                <p>Arabella glanced up to find a man about her age hovering nearby, clearly nervous and blushing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to turn him down, a cold,calm voice interrupted out of nowhere. &#34;Mind stepping aside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher walked over, confident and composed, and sat down beside her. His striking looks and commanding presence were enough to make the man back off immediately. Flustered, the man muttered, &#34;Sorry, I didn&#39;t know she had a boyfriend,&#34; then quickly left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella turned to Asher. &#34;Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wrapped up some company stuff and thought I&#39;d drop by,&#34; he replied, his eyes settling on her.&#34;Why aren&#39;t you out there enjoying yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a soft shrug. &#34;It&#39;s just not really my thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everything she had been through, things like amusement park rides and crowded games didn&#39;t hold the same excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher looked at her for a moment, then lightly pinched her cheek. &#34;You&#39;re only nineteen. Don&#39;t act like life&#39;s already worn you out. Try to have some fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella rubbed her cheek. &#34;You&#39;re one to talk.You&#39;ve got the same serious vibe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher grinned. &#34;Fair point. Come on, let&#39;s take a walk.The view&#39;s nice this time of day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella nodded. The amusement park was glowing in the soft light of dusk. Everything looked warm and dreamy, wrapped in a golden haze. They walked together, their steps slow and easy, until they passed an old man selling cotton candy. &#34;Fresh cotton candy here!&#34; he called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take one,&#34; Asher said, stepping forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vendor quickly spun a big, fluffy piece and handed it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella raised an eyebrow. &#34;DidIn&#39;t know you liked sweet stuff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Asher held it out to her.&#34;Try it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated. &#34;Sometimes,&#34; he said gently, &#34;you just need to enjoy the little things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made her stop and think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she started at the national lab, her life had been a whirlwind of pressure and responsibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t even remember the last time she did something so simple and carefree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a bite, and in an instant, her mouth was covered in sugar. Asher laughed quietly and reached out with his long fingers to wipe it away.Then he licked it off his finger like it was no big deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tastes pretty good,&#34; he said with a smug grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks turned a deep red. She glared at him.&#34;You&#39;re impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing she didn&#39;t like being teased too much,Asher quickly added, &#34;Here, this way&#39;s easier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled off a small piece and fed it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella took a bite and noticed that this way, the sugar didn&#39;t stick to her mouth. &#34;Do you eat this a lot?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher shook his head. &#34;Not really. I usually just see other people eating it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, he would never choose something</p>
                
                
                
                <p>like this for himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; she said with a small smile, then kept nibbling on the cotton candy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As evening settled in, the air grew cooler,especially under the shade of the tall trees scattered throughout the park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella rubbed her arms to keep warm. Just then, a suit jacket gently fell over her shoulders,carrying a warm, familiar scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Asher. &#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not,&#34; he replied in a steady voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the soft glow of the night, Arabella thought Asher looked even more striking. Her heart warmed, and she gently tugged the jacket closer,trying to quiet the sudden swirl of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, let&#39;s sit for a bit,&#34; Asher said, taking her hand and guiding her to a nearby bench.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she sat down, the dark sky exploded with color. Fireworks lit up the air-bright, bold, and beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People all around the park stopped in awe,snapping photos of the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ed Dilfikea lh surprise. &#34;They do fireworks at night?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you like it?&#34; Asher asked, his eyes fixed gently on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Arabella looked up, her eyes met his. There were no fireworks shining in them, only her own reflection. Her heart skipped a beat as a thought suddenly hit her. &#34;Was this all your doing?&#34; she asked softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; he said softly. &#34;Do you like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do,&#34; Arabella said with a smile. &#34;But why fireworks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to surprise you,&#34; he replied, his tone warm and sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella went quiet, unsure what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher was amused by her troubled look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella, always composed, looked almost shy and Asher found that side of her incredibly endearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, he leaned in a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their breaths overlapped. Arabella found herself staring at his face, stunned into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their faces were so close, it felt like only a breath separated them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hey!&#34; A loud voice rang out nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy had been searching for Arabella and just happened to walk in on the moment. Without hesitation, she rushed over and shoved Asher aside. &#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; she snapped, glaring at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher stayed calm. &#34;Relax. I was just taking something out of her hair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And sure enough, he held up a tiny piece of paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy let out a breath, but she still looked irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He really has been pushing the limits lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella snapped out of it, realizing she had jumped to conclusions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie came up and spotted Asher. &#34;Wait, is this your boyfriend? He&#39;s really cute!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Arabella could say a word, Daisy blurted out,&#34;No! Just friends!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, got it,&#34; Karlie replied, picking up on the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>tension among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the fireworks faded and the night sky returned to calm, the group made their way out of the amusement park, bringing a joyful day to a close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at Avalon, the manager made one last round of checks, just as Arabella had asked, before heading out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was gone, a shadowy figure slipped into the kitchen. She pulled out a small bag and sprinkled something onto the food. It dissolved instantly, leaving no sign behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was done, the woman gave a sly,satisfied smile.</p>
