                <p>Asher kept his hands tucked in his pockets and looked as distant as ever. &#34;Did I ever actually say that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>River stood there, unable to come up with a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could not help but wonder. Had he misunderstood? But if that was the case, why had Asher never set the record straight before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the atmosphere growing awkward,River scratched his head and hurried to switch topics.&#34;Sorry for the confusion. I just guessed. So, are you studying Al as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a simple answer. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity got the better of River. &#34;Then which department are you with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile played on Arabella&#39;s lips. &#34;I&#39;m in dance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flashed across River&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never expected someone from the dance department to be so skilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization humbled him, even as a specialist in artificial intelligence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Asher, though, none of this was surprising.He had always known how remarkable Arabella was, and pride flickered in his eyes as he watched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance at the clock reminded Asher of their schedule. &#34;It&#39;s getting late. Should we go so you can prepare?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella nodded. &#34;Alright,&#34; she responded,remembering the banquet planned for that evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked off campus together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, Asher brought Arabella to an exclusive styling studio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping inside, Arabella was taken aback when she recognized the makeup artist. This was someone famous for working with celebrities and nearly impossible to book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the best would do for Asher, and he</p>
                
                
                
                <p>always made sure of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the makeup artist laid eyes on Arabella,surprise filled her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The makeup artist chatted as she worked. &#34;I&#39;ve never seen anyone quite as beautiful as you. No wonder Mr. Gordon is so captivated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella was left at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It puzzled her why people always seemed to misunderstand her relationship with Asher whenever they appeared together in public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not have the energy to clear things up anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher looked just as weary of the constant confusion. After giving the makeup artist a few brief instructions, he turned to Arabella. &#34;Stay here and let me know if you need anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella nodded. &#34;Alright,&#34; she replied, and Asher left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three hours slipped by while her makeup was completed. The staff then brought out several evening dresses for her to choose from.Arabella hesitated, uncertain of what to pick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The makeup artist smiled warmly. &#34;Mr. Gordon just finished getting ready too. Why not have him help you decide?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That seemed fair to Arabella, especially since she would be attending the banquet with him.&#34;Okay,&#34; she remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A staff member called for Asher, and before long, he walked back into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His presence seemed to light up the entire space.Every eye turned toward him at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was already striking in appearance, but the vintage black suit he wore made him even more magnetic. The tailored cut emphasized his broad shoulders and slender waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his hair slicked back, his features appeared even sharper, and his deep-set eyes held no visible emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was an effortless elegance about him that could easily attract the attention of many young women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The makeup artist clicked her tongue in appreciation. &#34;The two of you together will draw every eye in the room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher paid no attention to the remark and looked at the dresses instead. &#34;Is there one you like?&#34; he asked Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She studied the gowns for a moment, then pointed to an off-the-shoulder style. &#34;How about this one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher gave a small nod. &#34;Go ahead and try it on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff led Arabella to the fitting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short while later, she stepped out wearing the off-the-shoulder black gown. The sleek cut showed off her slim waist, and her bare shoulders looked soft and lovely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her graceful neck drew every eye, and the flawless makeup brought out her natural glow even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Asher could not look away,completely entranced by how beautiful she appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh came from the makeup artist.&#34;What do you think, Mr.Gordon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher snapped out of his trance. &#34;She looks stunning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella agreed, smoothing out her skirt. Before she could do anything else, Asher gently placed a black shawl around her shoulders. &#34;It&#39;s going to be cold with the air conditioning tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She responded quietly, &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The makeup artist let out a cheerful laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So many little excuses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one would have guessed that someone as distant as Asher would ever show this much affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By six-thirty that evening, the pair had reached the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire floor had been reserved for the banquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night&#39;s gathering centered around a major upcoming bidding event. It was one that could decide the future of an important project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guests filled the hall in their finest clothes,exchanging small talk while quietly sizing up one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Members of the Hyde, the Lambert, and the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tucker families were all present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over time, the relationships among these families had only grown deeper, especially thanks to the bonds formed by their children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden leaned in and whispered, &#34;I heard there&#39;s a special guest tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan Lambert, who was Joyce&#39;s father,answered with a hint of ambition, &#34;It makes sense. An event this big is bound to draw their attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Secretly, Nathan hoped to use this chance to connect with the Gordon family.</p>
