                <p>How could things unravel this way? Elissa was absolutely sure she shoved Arabella inside just moments ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory sharpened-she shoved Arabella in,but then the door swings open without warning.She barely has a second to react before someone shoved her through the doorway as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting inside was a vagrant she arranged, and the room was laced with a powerful aphrodisiac she personally set out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa glances quickly at the vagrant, catching a look of utter confusion mirrored in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So now she was the one who had been violated by this stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock was overwhelming. Rage threatened to knock her off her feet, and tears spilled down her cheeks as she shouted, &#34;You&#39;re wrong!That&#39;s not what happened! Daisy, you said you were exhausted and begged me to bring you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>here. After I got you settled, everything went black. Was this your trap from the beginning?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes in the room shifted toward Arabella as Elissa&#39;s words hung in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Elissa was telling the truth, then Daisy&#39;s cunning knew no bounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t a minor scandal-someone&#39;s entire reputation was on the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers of sympathy passed through the crowd, faces turning soft with pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outraged, Joyce charged at Arabella, her hand lifted in accusation. &#34;You bitch! I always knew you were behind this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella barely smiled as she caught Joyce&#39;s wrist in midair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle twist was all it took. Joyce hit the floor,stunned and defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp cry escaped Joyce as pain shot through her, a fresh scrape blooming on her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny hurried to her side and gently lifted her up,his face twisting in shock. In a troubled voice,he asked, &#34;You&#39;re all classmates, Daisy. Did you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>really have to do that to Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s reply was ice-cold. &#34;What is your problem? She&#39;s the one who tried to slap me first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury burned in Joyce&#39;s eyes. &#34;I went for you because you set Elissa up. You&#39;re cruel-how could you drag her name through the dirt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down Elissa&#39;s face, each sob laced with despair. &#34;Daisy, if you had something against me, you could&#39;ve said it to my face. You didn&#39;t need to go this far. I&#39;d rather not go on living!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The outrage in Joyce&#39;s voice filled the room.&#34;Just look at what you&#39;re doing, Daisy! You&#39;re pushing her right to the edge!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around, students exchanged uneasy glances,a wave of sympathy rising for Elissa&#39;s plight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the university president&#39;s voice cut through thetension. &#34;What&#39;sall this commotion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton and Asher appeared at his side, having followed the noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s quick steps slowed only when he</p>
                
                
                
                <p>spotted Arabella safe and sound, relief softening his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce wasted no time, launching into her version of events for the president. &#34;Sir, Daisy is the one behind this. She trapped Elissa,shattering her reputation. You can&#39;t just let Daisy walk away. She&#39;s beyond cruel!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s sobs echoed from her hiding spot behind a row of equipment. &#34;I can&#39;t take this,Daisy.You&#39;re so ruthless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a stern look, the president swept his gaze over the group, then focused on the vagrant and said, &#34;Tell me exactly what happened here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The president&#39;s stern gaze had the vagrant shrinking back, words tumbling from his lips. &#34;I heard about some sort of anniversary happening,so I wandered over. I stumbled on this equipment room and figured I&#39;d catch my breath inside. That&#39;s when someone shoved this student in after me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s lips curled in disdain. &#34;Don&#39;t be absurd.This was all set up ahead of time. Besides, has anyone else noticed how warm it&#39;s getting in here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few students glanced at each other. &#34;It really is kind of hot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone else chimed in, &#34;Wait, you think there&#39;s an aphrodisiac in the air?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;d go that far? That&#39;s crazy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cheeks started to flush around the room as the warmth spread, a visible wave of discomfort taking hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pitiful whimper escaped Elissa. &#34;Daisy, how could you be so ruthless? You set me up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not bothering to respond, Arabella crossed the floor,scooped up Elissa&#39;s discarded clothes, and fished a sachet out of one of the pockets. With a casual flick, she tossed it into the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cooling scent drifted through the group, the sensation sharp and immediate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did this just make the heat vanish? I actually feel&#39;better after taking a breath,&#34; someone remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same here! The heat is gone,&#34; someone added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a look that could freeze water, Arabella</p>
                
                
                
                <p>addressed Elissa. &#34;If the aphrodisiac came from me,explain why the antidote was hidden in your pocket.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic swept across Elissa&#39;s face. &#34;I-I didn&#39;t put it there. You must have planted it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella didn&#39;t miss a beat. &#34;Let&#39;s get it checked for fingerprints, then. I bet yours are all over it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood drained from Elissa&#39;s cheeks, leaving her white as a sheet.</p>
