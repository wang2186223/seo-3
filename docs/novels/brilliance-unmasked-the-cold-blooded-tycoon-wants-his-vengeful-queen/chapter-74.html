                <p>&#34;Are you paying any attention to what I&#39;m saying?&#34; Asher&#39;s voice turned icy cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nervous reply came right away. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Mr.Gordon. I was only thinking about how this might affect the school&#39;s reputation. We have to protect the school&#39;s good name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s tone was sharper than ever. &#34;So your idea of protecting the school is to cover things up with hush money? I want you to look into who knew Daisy was being bullied and stood by doing nothing. Give me a full list.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; the person responded quickly,not daring to say anything else before ending the call and rushing off to handle the task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher set his phone aside and looked over at Arabella. &#34;Sorry about that, Arabella,&#34; he said earnestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a gentle smile. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. You have a lot to deal with-it&#39;s only natural for a few things to get missed. No need to blame yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze drifted to the cat-shaped ring on his finger, and she grinned. &#34;How&#39;s it working out for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A genuine smile broke across Asher&#39;s face,brighter than she had ever seen. &#34;It&#39;s perfect.At this rate, I hardly need my personal doctor anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s own smile grew warmer. &#34;I&#39;m glad to hear that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Daisy watched them, a quiet smile spreading across her lips as she listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll drive you both tomorrow,&#34; Asher said, his voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Arabella replied, nodding.&#34;Dinner&#39;s almost ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sat down to share their meal, and afterward, everyone headed off to their rooms for the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a peaceful evening. The moon glowed softly over the city, casting a blanket of calm, as if nothing could disturb the night. But while everything felt serene at home, Arabella&#39;s live stream channel online was drawing more and more attention. Viewers flooded in, all wanting to find out the truth about the bullies at Griridge University and what had really happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning after breakfast, Asher drove them to the designated place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella had already reserved a conference hall for the meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting was scheduled for eleven,but by ten-thirty the conference hall was already packed with people eager for drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella, Daisy and Asher took their seats near the back of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes before eleven, Joyce, Elissa,and Kenny entered. Elissa moved slowly, supporting herself with a pair of crutches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked in, the crowd&#39;s attention locked onto them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Arabella had never released their names to the public, online investigators had already put the story together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that them? They look so normal-hard to believe what they&#39;ve done behind the scenes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s Elissa in the middle, right? She seems so sweet, but you can tell she&#39;s just pretending!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How shameless can you get?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone in the crowd hurled an egg, just missing Elissa&#39;s white dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury flickered across her face as she faced the noisy crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them headed to the front,where</p>
                
                
                
                <p>seats had been reserved on the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgusted glances and whispers filled the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa shifted uncomfortably in her chair, but deep down, she felt thrilled, convinced that soon she would get her revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, the large screen behind the stage came to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turned to look. It now displayed a flood of photos and videos showing Joyce,Elissa, and Kenny bullying other students. Their victims&#39; faces were blurred out, but every detail of their own faces was crystal clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock rippled across their expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the images were so old, even they struggled to remember when they had been taken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was no&#39; denying it-every one of those pictures showed the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella had managed to dig up every last piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, everyone. Today, I will show you the real faces of the three notorious bullies from Griridge University.&#34; A cold, steady voice echoed from the back of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella moved to the front, her face covered by a mask, yet her poise and striking beauty still stood out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s eyes grew wide with fear. &#34;Arabella,you...you&#39;re not-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella finished the thought for her. &#34;Dead,is that what you&#39;re trying to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa quickly tried to compose herself, forcing a cold edge into her voice. &#34;What do you want now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it! Arabella just wouldn&#39;t go away, no matter what they tried. All that money spent was for nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage burned inside Elissa, but she knew this wasn&#39;t the time to let it show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s voice was cold and steady. &#34;As I said,please explain to everyone what you&#39;ve done at Griridge University over the years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s head dropped as tears slid down her cheeks, her white dress making her look even more fragile. &#34;I&#39;ll admit it. I made some mistakes, and I&#39;m truly sorry,&#34; she said, her voice trembling. &#34;But I had my reasons. It wasn&#39;t all my fault-she brought it on herself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, her tone grew sharp and defensive,startling the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People blinked in surprise, then turned to each other with confused and angry whispers. &#34;What is she even saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s still trying to make excuses? Give me a break!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable. I&#39;ve seen the evidence. This is plain bullying. There&#39;s no excuse-she needs to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>apologize!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was filled with murmurs of disgust,nobody buying Elissa&#39;s explanations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa glared at Arabella. &#34;You claim I bullied you,but what exactly did I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change. &#34;Let&#39;s start with what you did to my sister Daisy-how you broke her leg.&#34;</p>
