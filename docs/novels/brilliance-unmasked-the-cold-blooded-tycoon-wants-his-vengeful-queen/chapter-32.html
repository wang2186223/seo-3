                <p>Dominick tried to downplay the matter. &#34;It&#39;s probably nothing serious, Mr. Gordon. Just a few rumors spreading online.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steely edge crept into Asher&#39;s voice, calm yet unmistakably firm.&#34;Show me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without delay, Dominick passed the iPad into his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few quick swipes brought up the university&#39;s online forum for Asher to scan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you believe how Daisy acted? She owes everything to Elissa&#39;s family and still took her place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another chimed in, &#34;Didn&#39;t Elissa get kicked out for plagiarism?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone quickly interjected, &#34;That wasn&#39;t true!Kenzie confessed they choreographed that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>dance together. Elissa never meant to copy Isabella&#39;s routine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sympathy filled the comments. &#34;Elissa can&#39;t catch a break. First Kenzie, now Daisy. If I were Daisy, I&#39;d have turned down the offer to join the troupe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Judgment was harsh and direct. &#34;Anyone with a heart would refuse that role.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Support for Elissa poured in. &#34;She&#39;s shameless for taking that spot. Poor Elissa deserves better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toxic rumors weren&#39;t limited to the forum; soon,the entire Internet was awash with harsh criticism, labeling Daisy as unfeeling and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Asher&#39;s expression stayed stone-cold,Dominick could sense the anger simmering beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in, Dominick asked in a low voice,&#34;Should we intervene?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s response came crisp and decisive.&#34;This is our campus. If we don&#39;t handle it, who will?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick responded quickly, &#34;Understood. I&#39;ll check with Miss Stanley for her instructions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well before Dominick&#39;s call reached her,Arabella had already scrolled through the flood of gossip online. Calmly, she instructed him to hold off-no action needed for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the morning came, she showed up on campus just as she always did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Navigating the hallways, Arabella found herself treated like an outcast-classmates sidestepped her, sent sharp glances her way,and whispered behind their hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isolation followed her everywhere; not a soul offered so much as a greeting. Still, she moved through the crowds, her chin held high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Elissa enjoyed a ring of admirers,her friends huddled close around her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Arabella gone, Kenzie had been relegated to errand duty, running from one classmate to another,arms loaded with their requests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Kenzie&#39;s eyes met Arabella&#39;s with a trace of sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through class, a note sailed across the aisle from Kenzie&#39;s desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick flick of her fingers opened the folded paper. &#34;Daisy, you&#39;ve become truly pathetic. No one likes you. No one notices you. You could disappear and not a single person would care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pen in hand, Arabella scribbled a reply. &#34;It must be easy being someone else&#39;s servant all day.Enjoy it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tossed the note right back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie read the words, then balled up the paper in her fist, frustration plain on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a shaky breath, Kenzie scribbled another note and flicked it across the aisle. Arabella</p>
                
                
                
                <p>barely spared it a glance before tossing it straight into the trash, driving Kenzie&#39;s frustration even higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the bell neared, a stack of notebooks landed with a thud on Kenzie&#39;s desk. Joyce,popping her gum with a smirk, said, &#34;Finish my assignments, will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strained smile appeared on Kenzie&#39;s face.&#34;Sure, Joyce. There&#39;s quite a pile today, though.Mind if I start with half?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer set Joyce off. She grabbed a fistful of Kenzie&#39;s hair and hissed, &#34;You got some nerve. Stay up all night if you have to, but l expect it all done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie froze, shock flickering across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spectacle only amused Joyce further.&#34;What&#39;s this? Planning to be a rebel like Daisy?You even know your own worth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation laced Kenzie&#39;s words as she rushed to explain, &#34;No way, Joyce. I&#39;d never.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;re friends-she means nothing to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s laughter exploded, sharp and cruel.&#34;Friends? Is that what you think? Because Elissa let you stand near her, you believe you belong with us? Open your eyes. You&#39;re just here to serve. Remember your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mockery rang out all around, other students joining in the laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenzie stared at the sneers and contempt on every face, her whole body tensing,humiliation washing over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to bear it, she bowed her head, tears spilling silently down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surviving until graduation seemed impossible with so much pressure closing in on every side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of memory brought Arabella&#39;s words back to Kenzie, and regret flooded her thoughts. Had she never chased Elissa&#39;s approval, maybe college could have been simple-maybe even peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the lesson ended, Arabella remained slouched over her desk, her appetite gone and her only plan to catch a bit of sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around her, the room hummed with chatter,every word tinged with ridicule and derision.</p>
