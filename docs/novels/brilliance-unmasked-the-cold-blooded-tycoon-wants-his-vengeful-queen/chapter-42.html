                <p>Khloe&#39;s devoted followers swarmed around her like moths drawn to flame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting Khloe in person, her followers found themselves mesmerized by her beauty. The mask concealed half her face, making her appear virtually identical to her polished live stream persona.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then their eyes landed on Arabella, and they became utterly spellbound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this be Koko&#39;s cousin?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was absolutely stunning, She&#39;s got this...aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might even outshine Khloe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe&#39;s jaw clenched so tightly her teeth nearly cracked. As someone who had built her entire kingdom on the altar of appearance,watching her own worshippers be lured away by Arabella&#39;s natural glow was like swallowing glass. Arabella didn&#39;t just turn heads-she shattered egos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Khloe pasted on a sugary smile, though it tasted bitter. &#34;I really appreciate everyone coming</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to stand with me. But rest assured-Arabella knows she messed up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single line pulled her followers back to Earth,snappingthe spell. No matter how dazzling Arabella looked, in their eyes, she was still the villain of the story-the one who had turned on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their expressions hardened into masks of hostility as one of them said, &#34;Koko, we&#39;re here to get your house back! You must be Arabella, right?Koko&#39;s family sacrificed everything for you,and you threw them out like trash. You have no shame! If you don&#39;t return the house to Koko,we&#39;re staying here until you do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan stepped forward, her face a masterpiece of manufactured helplessness. &#34;Arabella, before your parents died, they begged me to care for you and Daisy. The house was meant as our compensation for that sacrifice. Now that you&#39;ve grown up, how can you treat me so cruelly? lt breaks my heart!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her hand to her chest and released a theatrical sigh. She had spent extra time applying makeup to appear even more worn down today,crafting the perfect image of a woman destroyed by ingratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Meagan resembled most of the fans&#39;mothers in age, the crowd&#39;s emotions intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone hurled their thermos at Arabella,screaming, &#34;You heartless, ungrateful witch! Give the house back to Koko! Without them, you and your sister would have died on the streets!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella sidestepped the projectile with fluid grace and released a laugh that froze the air around them. She caught the triumphant gleam flickering in Meagan&#39;s eyes and spoke with deliberate, cutting slowness. &#34;Aunt Meagan, it seems you truly cannot let go of this house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan&#39;s defensive mask slipped for just a moment. &#34;This isn&#39;t about the property. I&#39;m heartbroken by your ingratitude! I raised you and Daisy from children, and you don&#39;t have an ounce of appreciation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe&#39;s fans exploded with renewed fury. &#34;Your aunt showed you such kindness, and this is how you repay her family. You have no conscience at all. You&#39;re a despicable person. Go to hell!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly, give back the house!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She looks decent, but she&#39;s rotten to the core!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd pulsed with dangerous energy, their anger feeding off itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan savored the moment, her satisfaction blooming like poison in her chest. She felt certain victory was within her grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She studied Arabella with barely concealed contempt. Arabella&#39;s father had possessed real capability, but Arabella was just a girl-how much power could she possibly wield?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Controlling Arabella and Daisy had always been child&#39;s play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Meagan had made a fatal miscalculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You claim to have cared for us, but honestly, I think you and your family gained far more than we ever did,&#34; Arabella said, her voice slicing through the air like a sharpened blade. &#34;After you moved into this house, you built connections throughout the neighborhood. Your company reaped tremendous benefits. Most people only did business with you because of your supposed close relationship with my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What complete nonsense are you spouting?Your father had been dead for years. We earned these connections through our own hard work!&#34;Meagan snapped back, her eyes turning to ice.&#34;Arabella, do you honestly think spreading lies will make people believe you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Tucker.&#34; The voice cut through the tension like thunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An elegantly dressed woman approached, her expression darkening as she fixed her gaze on Meagan. &#34;What exactly are you claiming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan turned pale. She hadn&#39;t expected to run into Gracie Pearson, not here, not today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weren&#39;t the Pearsons supposed to be out of the country?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh! Mrs. Pearson, you&#39;re back?&#34; Meagan stumbled into a smile, the kind meant to smooth over disasters. &#34;It&#39;s nothing, really. I had no idea you were back in town-l was just about to visit you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracie&#39;s face remained carved from stone. &#34;What did you just say? I remember making it crystal clear when we worked together that it was solely because of Arabella&#39;s father. Otherwise, why would I do business with an insignificant company like yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracie&#39;s arrival and her devastating words crushed Meagan&#39;s confidence and left Khloe&#39;s fans reeling in stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s expression softened at the sight of Gracie, warmth breaking through her icy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her father had always maintained excellent relationships with everyone in the neighborhood,especially the Pearsons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracie approached Arabella, her eyes brimming with genuine concern. &#34;Arabella, you&#39;ve finally come home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been far too long, Mrs. Pearson,&#34; Arabella replied, her voice carrying gentle warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s all this?&#34; Gracie inquired, her tone sharp with disapproval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe, feeling utterly humiliated by Gracie&#39;s crushing words, whined defensively, &#34;But my parents... they&#39;ve supported you for years,Arabella. They poured time and money into raising you. How can you be so heartless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the last syllable left her lips, Arabella hurled a thick stack of papers straight at Khloe&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe scrambled to retrieve them from the ground, and her expression transformed into one of pure horror as she absorbed what was written.</p>
