                <p>Losing her place in the dance troupe added another blow to Elissa&#39;s already bruised pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The root of all these troubles seemed to trace right back to Arabella&#39;s unexpected return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With clenched fists, Elissa entered the living room, finding Bennie mid-discussion with Meagan about the company&#39;s troubles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration weighed heavy in Bennie&#39;s voice.&#34;Managing this company gets tougher every day,&#34; he muttered, sighing in exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of anxiety ran through Elissa at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of returning to a life without luxury filled her with dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to her father, she asked, &#34;Dad, is there</p>
                
                
                
                <p>any hope for fresh investment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennie shook his head, exhaling smoke.&#34;Things get worse with every passing day. If nothing changes soon, we&#39;ll be bankrupt before long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not ready to give up, Elissa continued, &#34;What about the project I mentioned last time? Have you spoken to anyone about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded wearily. &#34;I did reach out, but hardly anyone believes in it. Banks have turned us down, and even family can&#39;t help-your uncles and aunts just don&#39;t have the funds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic crept into Meagan&#39;s voice. &#34;We can&#39;t just let the business go under!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa cut straight to the point. &#34;Exactly how much cash do we have left to work with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calculating quickly, Bennie answered, &#34;We can scrape together $50 million, at best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thoughtful look came over Elissa. &#34;Since the project isn&#39;t exactly in demand,competition will</p>
                
                
                
                <p>be thin. Vanguard Group isn&#39;t expected to bid high either, and their estimate hovered around $80 million. If we can pool just a bit more than that, the contract could be ours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to her father, she suggested, &#34;Dad, why don&#39;t we sell the remaining properties and push our relatives to chip in more? Surely, they&#39;re interested in a solid return. This is it-our last shot. Projects that catch Vanguard Group&#39;s eye usually multiply their investors&#39; money five or six times over. Are we seriously going to let everything slip away without a fight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennie found himself leaning toward her plan.&#34;You&#39;re right. We can&#39;t miss this window. I&#39;ll start making calls immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan chimed in, eager to help, &#34;I&#39;ll see what can get from my circle as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa planned to help as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Living in this penthouse was only a temporary fix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one successful project, their family could move right back into a luxury villa in the city&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their status would be restored among the elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Arabella, she would be left behind,saddled with her ailing sister. Once the proceeds from the villa sale dried up, she would have no choice but to get a job-maybe even beg them for work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That delicious thought brought a satisfied smile to Elissa&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, something else occurred to her.&#34;Dad, do you know what became of Arabella&#39;s father&#39;s company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity stirred-Elissa tried to recall details about the business Arabella&#39;s father had run before his death, wondering how things had turned out for the company he left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing to recall, Bennie finally answered, &#34;After his death, the company just couldn&#39;t keep</p>
                
                
                
                <p>going. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s out of business by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dismissive snort came from Meagan. &#34;Of course it is. If you ask me, he was too tight-fisted with his assets. If he&#39;d handed the company over to us sooner, maybe things would have been different. Family&#39;s supposed to help each other, not hoard everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arriving at the villa in Gracebourne, Arabella picked up the sounds of conversation before she even stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight that greeted her was Dominick and Asher occupying the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A polite greeting came from Dominick. &#34;Good evening,Miss Stanley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s gaze met hers, but his expression revealed nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity flickered across Arabella&#39;s face. &#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s reply was as cool as ever. &#34;You invited me to crash with you yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memory flickered-she did recall saying that,though she hadn&#39;t expected him to take her up on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick&#39;s eyes landed on what she held in her arms. &#34;May I ask what you&#39;ve brought with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella handed the bundle to a waiting servant.&#34;Just some things that belonged to my parents and Daisy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small smile, she suggested, &#34;I was about to start cooking. Since you&#39;re both here, why not stay for dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick didn&#39;t hesitate to refuse. &#34;Appreciate the offer, but something urgent just came up at work. I have to run.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made his exit in a rush, not sparing a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s attention drifted from his departing assistant to Arabella. &#34;You know we have a professional chef here,&#34; he remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella responded calmly, &#34;What I make is nothing like what the chef prepares-mine is a lot healthier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, she wouldn&#39;t have stepped into the kitchen at all if Asher hadn&#39;t shown up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After letting the silence linger, Asher finally gave a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved around the kitchen with practiced speed. While they ate, Arabella couldn&#39;t help but notice Asher&#39;s every gesture-his manners and quiet elegance marked him as someone born into privilege.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A question broke the stillness. &#34;How are you holding up these days?&#34; Asher asked, his gaze steady and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The true meaning behind his words was clear to Arabella-he was talking about all the criticism</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and rumors. She met his eyes and shook her head. &#34;None of that matters to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As dinner ended, Arabella made her way to Daisy&#39;s room, where she lifted the lid on a small box and pulled out a photo album.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite everything she had endured, Daisy had always kept these albums safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Page after page showed a happy family of four.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Softly, Arabella ran her fingers across the smiling faces of her parents. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry,Mom, Dad. I couldn&#39;t protect Daisy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears clouded her vision until she could barely see the photographs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Restless and sorrowful, she wandered back downstairs, grabbed a few bottles of wine, and sat alone with her memories and pictures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden buzz from her phone interrupted her solitude.</p>
