                <p>support, especially since the Hyde family had been losing influence. Still, KKenny was clearly not satisfied. He had someone else on the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A distressed voice echoed through the phone,asking, &#34;Why aren&#39;t you here with me? Why did you go to the banquet instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s sharp hearing immediately picked up on who was speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So it was Elissa on the other end of the call?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella could hardly believe these two were secretly involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what did that mean for Joyce?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of sympathy for Joyce swept over Arabella. All this time, Joyce had been nothing more than a pawn for Elissa, never suspecting that Elissa was already involved with her own boyfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Joyce ever learned the truth, things would take a dramatic turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile played on Arabella&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny sounded completely at a loss. &#34;Tonight&#39;s banquet could change everything for my</p>
                
                
                
                <p>family&#39;s business. You know how important next month&#39;s bidding event is, right? My dad&#39;s depending on me to help secure a major project. Elissa, you know you&#39;re the only one 「care about. I&#39;m only with Joyce because you asked me to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella found the whole situation even more entertaining than she had expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Kenny stayed with Joyce only because Elissa wanted it that way? He was willing to go that far just to please her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella could not help but admit that Elissa truly had a talent for keeping men under her control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her curiosity piqued, Arabella&#39;s eyes gleamed with anticipation. She was already thinking about stirring things up before finally revealing the truth behind the bullying at school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>enny spent a few minutes reassuring Elissa,t his phone buzzed with an urgent message om his father, so he had to end the call for OW.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/hen he returned to the banquet, Joyce was uick to approach him. &#34;Kenny, where did you isappear to? You were gone for so long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An old friend called me to talk about omething important. What&#39;s going on?&#34; he answered casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes lit up. &#34;The Tucker family just came up with a brilliant idea!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That caught Kenny&#39;s attention. &#34;What sort of idea?&#34; he asked, trailing after her toward the adults. Hayden and Nathan were already standing close, listening carefully as Bennie explained his latest project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden looked skeptical. &#34;Is this project even possible? I can&#39;t see where the profit would come from.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennie leaned in and said in a low voice,&#34;You&#39;d be surprised. The quietest projects sometimes bring in the biggest returns. Think about it.Why would Mr. Willis be interested if there was nothing there? Do you really know what kind of person he is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, everyone doubted Joshua&#39;s abilities,but within a year, he proved his worth. Any project he touched seemed destined for success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vanguard Group was now leading the way,having risen to the top unexpectedly and setting the pace for all of Griridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with this information, Hayden and Nathan exchanged uncertain looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, both received an alert at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden glanced at his phone and saw a message from an unfamiliar number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;People who bully others always face the consequences!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attached was a disturbing image showing evidence of how Kenny had spread lies about Daisy at school. The message ended with a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>warning. &#34;By the tenth of next month, Kenny must come here, confess, and publicly apologize for everything he&#39;s done!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An address came after the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every word he read, Hayden&#39;s expression grew even darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan looked just as troubled. Compared to Kenny, Joyce&#39;s behavior was even more outrageous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was even security footage attached showing Joyce bullying Daisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last sentence was clear and harsh. &#34;By the tenth of next month,I expect Joyce to show up here and apologize in public, or the Lambert family will be finished in Griridge. I promise you&#39;ll pay the price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan&#39;s face turned red with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was not upset with Joyce for what she had done, but he could notstand being threatened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever sent this message had gone so far as to get his private number. That alone meant this was not just an idle threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Bennie checked his own phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shocking images appeared. Photos of Elissa,exposed in the equipment room at school, were followed by shots of her grinning while others tormented Daisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new demand flashed on his screen. &#34;If you want to protect your family, make sure Elissa comes here before the tenth of next month.She must apologize publicly and admit to everything she&#39;s done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shiver ran through Bennie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately knew Arabella was behind this.That woman had already taken that house and now she refused to give them a moment&#39;s peace!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of the three could hide how shaken they felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden forced himself to say composed as he glanced at Kenny. &#34;I need to take care of something. I&#39;ll be heading out now,&#34; he said,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>holding back his frustration as he left the banquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nathan gave a short nod. &#34;There are some things I need to handle as well. We can talk another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,he left, taking Joyce with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennie could not bring himself to remain at the event either.When he reached home, he found Elissa sobbing in Meagan&#39;s arms, while Khloe stood nearby looking deeply troubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennie stared in disbelief. &#34;Tell me the truth.Did you really go to the equipment room today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan jumped to Elissa&#39;s defense right away.&#34;She&#39;s already under so much stress. Why are you being so harsh? Are you trying to push her over the edge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw clenched, Bennie simply handed them his phone so they could read the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their faces turned even paler as they finished reading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe cried out in outrage, &#34;It&#39;s Arabella! Tha awful woman-what does she want from us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennie let out a shaky breath. &#34;If this comes tc light, Elissa, how will you ever face anyone again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa had already suffered the humiliation of expulsion at school. She never imagined coming home only to be hit with such devastating news.Tears filled her eyes as dizziness set in,leaving her reeling at how her once easy life had spiraled into a nightmare.</p>
