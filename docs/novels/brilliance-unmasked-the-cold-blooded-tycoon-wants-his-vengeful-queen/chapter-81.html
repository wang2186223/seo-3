                <p>Arabella&#39;s fingers traced the pendant&#39;s surface before she opened it once more, her touch reverent as she caressed the photograph nestled within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Creating something this intricate demanded more than steady hands-it required tools of extraordinary precision, each movement calculated to perfection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her contemplation shattered when her phone&#39;s shrill cry pierced the silence. A doctor&#39;s voice carried urgent news. &#34;Bella, you wanted me to monitor Elissa&#39;s progress. Her situation has deteriorated dramatically-her leg is decomposing, and walking may never be possible again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Decomposing? What could have caused such</p>
                
                
                
                <p>devastation?&#34; Arabella&#39;s brow furrowed with confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The circumstances baffle me as well. My investigation revealed something disturbing-Elissa carries poison within her system. It operates with cruel subtlety, undermining her defenses over extended periods, manifesting in countless debilitating symptoms. Death won&#39;t claim her immediately, but suffering will define her remaining years. The troubling reality extends beyond her case...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor&#39;s voice then descended into hushed tones. &#34;Khloe endures identical torment. Her facial scars have worsened, beginning their own grotesque decay. Meagan collapsed from overwhelming anxiety upon learning the truth,and our tests revealed her immunity had plummeted below normal thresholds. All three women exhibit symptoms that mirror...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AIDS.&#34; Arabella breathed the word into existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Precisely. The situation defies explanation.Only a skilled toxicologist could orchestrate such sophisticated destruction,&#34; the doctor admitted, bewilderment threading through their words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s memory seized upon a discovery from Daisy&#39;s residence-The Ancient Healer&#39;s Handbook,that mysterious medical tome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath caught as she whispered with desperate urgency, &#34;This information must remain buried from other eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation ended, leaving Arabella collapsed against the sofa cushions, her emotional landscape in chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cherished sister-once radiating sweetness and vivacious energy-had she truly mastered the dark art of poison creation in shadowed secrecy? Daisy had embodied pure kindness and untainted innocence in.years past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bella.&#34; Daisy&#39;s melodic voice floated from the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>doorway&#39;s threshold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s gaze snapped upward, her composure reassembling with practiced swiftness. &#34;Please, come inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy glided into the room, her observant eyes studying Arabella&#39;s expression with careful attention. &#34;Your appearance troubles me. What weighs upon your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing of consequence. What brings you to my presence?&#34; Arabella said, though the doctor&#39;s alarming words continued their relentless circulation through her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Longing for your company brought me here!&#34;Daisy&#39;s radiant smile bloomed as she settled beside Arabella, her arms encircling her sister&#39;s with affectionate warmth. &#34;Does tomorrow hold any obligations? Would you accompany me to the dance troupe&#39;s gathering?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those innocent eyes sparked something protective within Arabella&#39;s heart, and she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>couldn&#39;t suppress her indulgent smile.&#34;Absolutely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s great!&#34; Daisy&#39;s excitement illuminated her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity then colored her tone as she ventured,&#34;| witnessed your conversation with Asher earlier. Did it carry significant weight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing particularly meaningful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well, if privacy surrounds the matter, l understand completely.Promise me you&#39;ll seek rest at an early hour!&#34; Daisy&#39;s sweet smile graced her lips once more before she departed from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s gaze followed Daisy&#39;s retreating form.She struggled to reconcile her beloved sister&#39;s gentle nature with the possibility of such ruthless poisoning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unknown to Arabella, Daisy&#39;s path leddirectly to the study, where she pushed open the door with deliberate purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher remained bent over his work, her arrival failing to surprise him in the slightest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy approached with measured steps, her eyes fixed downward upon his concentrated figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re into Arabella,&#34; she declared, her words carrying certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher abandoned his tasks and met her gaze,his response delivered with unshakeable calm,&#34;What outcome do you desire?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and Arabella exist on separate trajectories.Your family thrives on manipulation and calculated schemes, and furthermore, your engagement to another woman remains intact!&#34;Daisy&#39;s voice carried undertones of rising fury.&#34;Arabella would never unite herself with your cause. Abandoning this pursuit would serve you well. Tomorrow marks our departure from this place!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Innocence had vanished completely from</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s demeanor-only arctic coldness inhabited her eyes now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This dramatic transformation failed to catch Asher off guard. He had already penetrated the carefully constructed layers of Daisy&#39;s true character.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella remained blinded by the masterful facade her sister maintained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having delivered her inflammatory challenge,Daisy prepared to pivot toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But will Arabella discover happiness once she departs from here?&#34; Asher&#39;s question emerged with unhurried deliberation. &#34;No soul in this world possesses the capacity to provide her with greater abundance than I can offer.Beside me, her existence could transform into something infinitely more effortless. She has already sacrificed tremendous portions of herself for your benefit. Do you truly wish to condemn her to perpetual exhaustion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s movement ceased abruptly, her body freezing mid-stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had observed how Arabella&#39;s tension melted away whenever Asher graced their vicinity with his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth struck her with undeniable force-Asher embodied the perfect fusion of extraordinary wealth and devastating physical appeal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nevertheless, surrender remained foreign to Daisy&#39;s nature. &#34;I&#39;ll become her pillar of strength! I refuse to allow you to steal her from my embrace!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terror gripped her heart at the thought that,after finally reclaiming Arabella&#39;s poresence, she might witness her sister&#39;s departure once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Occasionally, merely observing other women&#39;s sisters embrace matrimony left Daisy gasping for breath, suffocated by overwhelming dread.The prospect of watching Arabella exchange</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wedding vows would prove absolutely unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My lineage represents a distinguished family whose legacy spans centuries. Do you genuinely believe overnight transformation could elevate you to match such formidable standing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher then added, &#34;Furthermore, stealing Arabella from your side never entered my intentions. Her devotion to you runs deeper than ocean currents. Separating you two would be impossible, and frankly, no one but myself would even attempt to preserve that sacred bond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His response flowed with measured tranquility and infinite patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s hands formed tight fists at her sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her reluctance to acknowledge the reality, Asher&#39;s words carried undeniable truth within their depths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Gordon family&#39;s protective umbrella could indeed transform Arabella&#39;s existence into something magnificently easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s glare burned into Asher&#39;s composed features. &#34;What fate awaits your promised bride?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does a simple verbal declaration truly constitute genuine engagement in your understanding?&#34; Asher&#39;s reply carried arctic coolness. &#34;Had I desired it, she would have become my wife already. However, my heart beats exclusively for Arabella.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s teeth sank into her lower lip, her mind scrambling unsuccessfully for any meaningful counterargument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s voice continued its relentless advance.&#34;Rest assured, your hidden nature will remain buried within my silence. Through Arabella&#39;s eyes,you shall eternally remain her cherished,sweet younger sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had better honor that promise!&#34; Daisy&#39;s sharp retort preceded her furious departure from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one complex matter finally reaching resolution, Asher permitted a subtle smile to grace his lips, his shoulders releasing their accumulated tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tranquil moment shattered when his phone erupted into demanding rings. He lifted the device, and a woman&#39;s voice emerged-so gentle and melodious that it possessed the power to ensnare any ordinary man&#39;s heart completely. &#34;I&#39;ve come home, Asher. Would tomorrow evening&#39;s dinner hold appeal for you?&#34;</p>
