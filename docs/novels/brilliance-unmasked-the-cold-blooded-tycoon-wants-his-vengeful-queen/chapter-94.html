                <p>The air in the restaurant felt heavy with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s place was a fancy, upscale spot, and it happened to be Bob&#39;s biggest rival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the customers here were rich and influential.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if some of them didn&#39;t personally deal with the Hudson family, there was always the risk that a friend or relative might. Rosie knew what she was doing. Just one calculated threat from her could jeopardize Arabella&#39;s entire future in this business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After thinking it through, most guests decided it was safer not to return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was unfortunate for Arabella, but people thought she had asked for it by upsetting the Hudsons-one of the richest families in Ockford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie kept her eyes on Arabella, expecting her to panic or show some remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Arabella only gave a slight smile and said calmly, &#34;Must be nice being a Hudson-say a few</p>
                
                
                
                <p>words and suddenly you think you can get away with anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie&#39;s lips curled. &#34;Whatever,&#34; she snapped,then turned and strode out with Raven still clinging to her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they stepped outside, Raven, still coughing dramatically, leaned in and said smugly,&#34;After that little performance? There&#39;s no way anyone will dare step foot in that place again.That woman&#39;s got no clue who she&#39;s dealing with!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the kind of power the Hudsons held-no one dared to challenge them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet Rosie didn&#39;t look satisfied. She wasn&#39;t smiling. This entire situation had been beneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for Asher, she wouldn&#39;t have wasted her time on this place. Her jaw tightened in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Raven gasped and tugged her arm.&#34;Rosie...look!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held out her phone, her eyes wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the screen was a post by none other than Felix Saville-a top-tier celebrity with millions of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>followers. He had uploaded a picture from inside Avalon, along with a caption that read, &#34;Beautiful.Delicious. Loved it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single post from Felix was enough to send his entire fan base into a frenzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People nearby who had seen the tweet in real time lit up with excitement. &#34;This is it! This is the place Felix just posted about!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks so classy! If he came here, I want to try it too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The floodgates burst open. Crowds began pouring into the restaurant, eager to eat at the same spot their idol had just praised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie&#39;s face darkened instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why on earth would Felix publicly support Arabella&#39;s restaurant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone buzzed again. She glanced down and her blood ran cold. She had been following Asher on Twitter, and he rarely posted anything personal. But now, he had shared a picture of a restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just from the dishes shown, Rosie knew it was Avalon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caption was simple. &#34;Quite impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage bubbled up inside Rosie. She was about to lose it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher was actually here? Had he seen everything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic kicked in, and her eyes shot up-there he was, standing by the floor-to-ceiling window on the second floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was looking down like a king watching over his land. Their eyes locked, and his gaze was cold and sharp under the sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath caught in her throat, and for a moment, the world seemed to tilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher clearly knew she had come here to make trouble for Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had worked hard to seem refined and graceful in front of Asher, certain she stood out from the rest-someone worthy of him. But now,the very first time she tried to scheme, he had caught her red-handed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to run and hide. But after Asher&#39;s public praise, the public would clearly side with the Gordons over the Hudsons. If Arabella&#39;s restaurant kept thriving, the Hudson name would</p>
                
                
                
                <p>take a serious hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that pride and posturing? It had completely backfired on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, Rosie bit her lip and dragged herself back into the restaurant, where customers were now whispering excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait... was that really Asher up there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gordon actually recommended this place!That&#39;s huge! Is he somehow connected to the owner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who cares if he is? I&#39;m definitely coming back.Maybe we&#39;ll get to see him again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The energy had shifted completely. No one seemed to remember Rosie&#39;s earlier threats.Feeling the sting of embarrassment, she forced a smile. &#34;I&#39;m sorry for what I said earlier. Today&#39;s meal is on me-please don&#39;t take anything to heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd stayed silent. No one responded.Humiliated,Rosie turned and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she got into the car, the tears came rushing out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven glanced at her and tried to help. &#34;Did you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>really have to pick a fight with this place? Was it because of Bob?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosie shut her eyes, her voice low. &#34;That&#39;s enough. Just drive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raven didn&#39;t press. Rosie&#39;s silence said it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though they were technically cousins, their relationship wasn&#39;t close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the extended family lived off the Hudson name, which was why Raven had even bothered showing up today-to back Rosie up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Arabella finally had a moment to respond to Felix&#39;s text now that the chaos had passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix replied, &#34;It&#39;s the least I could do. No need to thank me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella typed back, &#34;Still. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then stepped into the VIP room, where Asher and Colton were already eating. Colton lit up the moment he saw her. &#34;Your food is incredible, Miss Stanley! Not like that fancy-looking but flavorless food at Bob&#39;s Cuisine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, the two restaurants weren&#39;t even comparable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason Bob&#39;s place was still holding on was because of the Hudson family&#39;s support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without that backing, hardly anyone would choose to eat there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks. Eat as much as you like,&#34; Arabella said kindly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed Colton fumbling with the wrapping of the signature dish and stepped in to help, quickly making one for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton took it with a grateful smile. &#34;This tastes amazing,&#34; he said happily, then glanced at Asher.&#34;Miss Stanley&#39;s cooking really is on another level.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he met Asher&#39;s icystare, his smile faded, and he almost choked on his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher turned to Arabella. &#34;Make one for me too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was even, his face unreadable, but there was a subtle flash of jealousy in his eyes that didn&#39;t go unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a small sigh.&#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made one quickly and handed it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher took a bite right fom her hand, his lips grazing her fingertips. Her hand trembled slightly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>at the touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton sat there in silence, awkwardly aware he was now the third wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, it finally made sense to him-why Rosie had come after Arabella earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had seen the whole scene play out downstairs with his own eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two carry on,&#34; Arabella said with a smile.&#34;I&#39;ve got to check on things outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was still opening day, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second she was gone, Colton leaned closer to Asher. &#34;Be honest. Have you fallen for her?&#34;</p>
