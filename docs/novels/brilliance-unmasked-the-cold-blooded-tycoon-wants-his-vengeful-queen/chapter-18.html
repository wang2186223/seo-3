                <p>Elissa shot Karlie a quick, dismissive look before locking eyes with Arabella. &#34;Compared to you?Yeah, I&#39;m the real talent here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elissa, why are you wasting time over here?&#34; A tall woman walked up, barely glancing at the other two as she focused on Elissa. &#34;Let&#39;s go. We need to finalize your routine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great!&#34; Elissa beamed and walked with her.&#34;Wait, are you serious? They&#39;re actually choosing my choreography?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For sure,&#34; Lailah Stevenson responded, flashing her a proud smile. &#34;Everyone loved what you came up with. Just a heads-up though-don&#39;t get too cozy with the backup dancers. I get that you&#39;re nice and all, but those girls are dying to steal your spot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah wasn&#39;t exactly keeping her voice down, and both girls heard every word. Karlie&#39;s hands curled into fists, but she stayed quiet and focused on practicing with Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Griridge Troupe, only raw talent mattered.Backup dancers like Karlie were always made to feel like they didn&#39;t belong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie understood she had to work twice as hard just to be noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, under a clear night sky, Karlie and Arabella walked out of the theater. Right across the street was Griridge&#39;s fancy mall, still alive with stylish folks showing off their high-end bags and expensive watches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they crossed the street, Arabella happened to catch sight of Lailah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, isn&#39;t that our team lead?&#34; Karlie exclaimed,surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella glanced over casually, not paying much attention-until she saw a tall man dressed in black, his suit blending into the shadows. There was something cold and intimidating about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Asher? What&#39;s he doing here?&#34; Arabella wondered silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s the gguy with her?&#34; Karlie asked. &#34;He&#39;s cute. Is that her boyfriend? Ugh, rich people always end up with each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope,&#34; Arabella replied flatly, not missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even from where she stood, she could clearly make out what Lailah was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, handsome. I&#39;ve been watching you,&#34; Lailah said with a flirty wink, oozing confidence. &#34;How about we trade numbers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her beauty and charm, Lailah was certain she would reel him in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher slowly took a drag from his cigarette, the way his sharp jawline stood out and his piercing eyes cut through the darkness making him impossible to ignore. He had that cold and distant vibe. Even Lailah, who had been around wealthy and powerful men before, was taken aback. No one came close to his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This guy&#39;s the ultimate trophy,&#34; Lailah thought smugly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Asher didn&#39;t say a word and just left her hanging in the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, not bad. He&#39;s got guts,&#34; she thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah let out a playful giggle as she slid out her business card and reached for Asher&#39;s suit pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could get close, Asher&#39;s eyes turned sharp, carrying a cold, dangerous edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, just then, Arabella stepped in, snatched the card, and slipped it right back into Lailah&#39;s pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah whirled around, clearly annoyed, only to come face-to-face with Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a calm but pointed tone, Arabella said, &#34;He&#39;s married, just so you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah&#39;s expression soured, her pride taking a hit,especially since Asher didn&#39;t say a word in her defense. Getting called out by Arabella in front of him felt like a slap to her ego.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? You could&#39;ve said that sooner,&#34; Lailah huffed, spinning on her heel. &#34;What a total waste of time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far off, Dominick came rushing over, clearly relieved. &#34;Miss Stanley, thank you. That could&#39;ve gone real bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew Asher&#39;s patience for nonsense was non-existent. If Arabella hadn&#39;t stepped in, Lailah might have seriously regretted her little stunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you guys doing out here?&#34; Arabella asked,totally unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gordon just wanted to get a look around.What about you, Miss Stanley? Late night stroll?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just on my way back home,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me call a ride for you,&#34; Dominick offered,pulling out his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Asher&#39;s father had made it clear-Arabella came first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could dial, Asher spoke up. &#34;Get in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick blinked, surprised. Since when did Asher let anyone ride with him? He usually hated sharing his space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella, however, didn&#39;t question it, and she simply got in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the spacious, luxurious car, Asher&#39;s presence was commanding. But Arabella stayed calm and collected. &#34;Thanks for the bedsheet last time,&#34; she said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher glanced at her. &#34;Don&#39;t mention it. So, you know when you&#39;re moving in yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a small, tight smile. She knew this wasn&#39;t about kindness-it was obligation. As long as he checked in and saw her and her sister were okay,he would be in the clear with his dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to wait a bit,&#34; she replied softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; He leaned back with his eyes closed,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the soft light tracing the sharp angles of his face,casting a light shadow under his lashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he relaxed, a calming scent reached him. It wasn&#39;t strong,just soft and pleasant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Way better than those strong perfumes,&#34; he thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened one eye and asked in a low voice,&#34;Are you wearing perfume?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella looked a bit confused. &#34;Nope. Probably just my laundry soap. It smells kinda nice,though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the dark circles under his eyes, she took a small sachet from her bag and held it out. &#34;You like the scent? It works great in your room. Helps you sleep better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher stared at it, unmoving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the front seat, Dominick cringed. Arabella had no idea Asher wasn&#39;t the type to accept things from others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Stanley, I could use some sleep help too...&#34;Dominick tried to jump in, hoping to ease the tension. But before he could finish,Asher reached out and took the sachet.</p>
