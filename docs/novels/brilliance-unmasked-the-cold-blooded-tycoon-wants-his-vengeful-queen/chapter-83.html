                <p>&#34;Lailah?&#34; Jennifer frowned slightly. &#34;Didn&#39;t Patrick recommend her? And knowing the kind of person Patrick is... I find that hard to believe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick Stone, one of the vice presidents of the Dance Association, handled publicity. He had been a respected dancer for many years, well-regarded in their circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella thought for a moment. &#34;If that&#39;s true,maybe Patrick&#39;s the one pulling the strings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer hesitated. Truth was, she had always gotten along well with Patrick. &#34;Actually,&#34; she said after a pause, &#34;he&#39;s dropping by today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, during a break in the studio, a tall figure walked in. Several of them stood and called out,&#34;Hello,Mr.Stone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick offered a warm smile. &#34;Taking a little break? That&#39;s good. We&#39;ve got a show coming up soon, so I just dropped by to see how things are going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah turned to him enthusiastically. &#34;We&#39;re all set! Would you like to see the routine now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; he said with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, Lailah called everyone to their positions. The dancers quickly got to their feet,and the music began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick stood there smiling, though his eyes gradually settled on Daisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel the weight of his gaze, sharp and focused, but it didn&#39;t faze her in the slightest.She kept dancing with the same grace and confidence as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick&#39;s smile faltered just a touch. Then,without drawing attention, he let a small marble fall from his hand, sending it rolling toward Daisy&#39;s feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she stepped on it, she could easily trip,maybe even get badly hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a calm voice cut in. &#34;MAr.Stone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella had stepped right on the marble, her calm gaze locked on Patrick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the briefest moment, Patrick&#39;s face twisted,but he quickly covered it with a polite smile.&#34;And you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Daisy&#39;s sister,&#34; Arabella replied casually,gesturing toward her. &#34;We&#39;ve always had each other&#39;s backs, so I just tend to worry if someone&#39;s trying to push her around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick&#39;s eyes briefly flickered, but his pleasant expression didn&#39;t waver. &#34;That&#39;s fair,&#34; he said smoothly. &#34;But don&#39;t worry. The vibe here is really upbeat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s hope it stays that way,&#34; Arabella said coolly. Then, as if remembering something, she glanced down. &#39;&#34;Oh, I think | stepped on something just now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crouched and picked up the marble,holding it up for everyone to see. &#34;Strange. This was just lying here. If someone had stepped on it mid-dance, it could&#39;ve caused a serious injury.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried through the studio,catching everyone&#39;s attention. Dancers gradually stopped and turned toward her, unsettledby the sight of the marble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not even allowed to bring stuff like this into the studio. How&#39;d it end up here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did someone drop it accidentally?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella looked straight at Patrick, her expression one of innocent confusion. &#34;You were the only one who came in just now, Mr.Stone. Did you happen to see who dropped this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick&#39;s smile tightened. &#34;No, I didn&#39;t notice anyone. It&#39;s a good thing you spotted it-let&#39;s tuck it away before someone gets hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, I&#39;ll hang onto it,&#34; Arabella replied sweetly,slipping the marble into her pocket with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Patrick was fuming. Was she messing with him on purpose, or had she just stumbled into this? If it was planned, her timing was perfect. And that little remark-was it a warning?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught Lailah&#39;s eye, and they exchanged a quick,loaded glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t the moment to act. Not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a pleasant tone, he said, &#34;Everyone&#39;s rehearsing right now. Even if you&#39;re Daisy&#39;s sister, this isn&#39;t really the place to linger. How about we step outside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Arabella replied casually and followed without resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sure of one thing now-after being caught red-handed, neither of them would dare make another move anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this little stunt had confirmed what she had suspected-Patrick was the one pulling strings for Lailah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, Arabella headed to her new restaurant to train the chefs on how to make food that was easy on the stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua had shown up as well, observing from the side as Arabella wrapped up a dish. It looked great and smelled even better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You never told me you could cook,&#34; Joshua said, surprised. But the moment he took a bite,his smile disappeared right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella looked confused. &#34;What&#39;s the matter?Does it taste awful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she remembered Asher and Daisy eating it without a single complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua struggled to get it down and leaned in,asking softly, &#34;Who else has eaten your cooking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Asher and Daisy,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget Daisy, but Asher? He must be crazy about you.&#34; Joshua chuckled and gave her a dramatic thumbs up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave him a rare look of annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua dropped the teasing and got serious.&#34;It&#39;s healthy, sure. But the taste? Kinda painful,to be honest. People don&#39;t eat ouut just for health -they want something that actually tastes good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it really that bad?&#34; Arabella took a bite and didn&#39;t see the problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joshua sighed. &#34;You&#39;ve been in labs too long.You&#39;re used to food most people wouldn&#39;t even sniff. No wonder your taste buds are shot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, turning to a nearby chef, he added, &#34;Hey make something for her, will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, the chef brought over a plate of garlic pork chops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella took a bite, and Joshua leaned in eagerly. &#34;Well? What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s tasty,&#34; she admitted. &#34;But way too greasy.That kind of oil content could give someone a fatty liver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when it hit Joshua-Arabella&#39;s standards were way too rigid when it came to food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, fine. Let&#39;s find some middle ground,&#34;he muttered in defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They spent the rest of the afternoon tinkering with recipes, but Arabella was still far from satisfied. Eventually, she had to put it on pause and go pick up Daisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bella!&#34; Daisy called out, rushing over the moment she saw her at the opera house entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella took her hand with a smile. &#34;Come on,let&#39;s go check out some houses!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Houses? What for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said you wanted to move out, didn&#39;t you?&#34;Arabella had thought it over. No matter what,Daisy came first.</p>
