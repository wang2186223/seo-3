                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine. Would you like a ride? Where do you need to go?&#34; Arabella offered, grateful she had driven her car today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, thank you so much,&#34; Gracie replied, her fingers gripping her purse with white-knuckled intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The destination wasn&#39;t far from where they stood.It was situated in Griridge&#39;s prime commercial district, dominated by three towering glass monuments that pierced the skyline-architectural marvels that had become the city&#39;s most recognizable landmark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella had always admired Gracie&#39;s reputation as a formidable businesswoman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now, deep lines of worry carved themselves into Gracie&#39;s features, transforming her usual confidence into something fragile and strained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering the treasured friendship Gracie had cultivated with her parents over the years,Arabella ventured gently, &#34;Has something happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no point in hiding it from you. My business has expanded internationally over the past decade, but I returned home for something crucial-a partnership opportunity with the Gordon Group,&#34; Gracie explained, her voice carrying a note of pride that flickered like a candle in the wind before dimming. &#34;However, Mr.Gordon&#39;s assistant contacted me earlier. Our proposal has been compromised. Another company submitted something nearly identical.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you would never steal someone else&#39;s work,&#34; Arabella declared with unwavering conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracie released a weary sigh, her shoulders sagging under an invisible weight. &#34;The other company plagiarized our ideas. But given Mr.Gordon&#39;s reputation, even when we&#39;re the victims, he&#39;ll interpret it as our failure to protect our own interests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder Gracie appeared on the brink of collapse, drowning in circumstances beyond her control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Gordon Group commanded such influence that countless firms would sacrifice anything for even a chance at collaboration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella pressed the accelerator, navigating</p>
                
                
                
                <p>through traffic with determined efficiency to reach the Gordon Group building as swiftly as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracie disappeared into the elevator while Arabella remained outside the building,her attention suddenly captured by an unwelcome but familiar presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>much more entertaining challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;ve been struggling lately,&#34; Kenny said, his tone shifting to mock sympathy. &#34;Choose me, and I&#39;ll make your problems disappear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny dismissed Arabella&#39;s words entirely,refusing to acknowledge her rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had convinced himself that she must have come seeking him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella studied Kenny with barely concealed disgust, her stomach churning with revulsion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could such a worthless creature ever deserve someone as pure as Daisy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then realization struck her like lightning.&#34;What brings you to this building?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haven&#39;t you heard? I&#39;m here to finalize a collaboration agreement with the Gordon Group,&#34;Kenny announced, his chest swelling with unearned pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pieces fell into place with sickening clarity.The thieves who had stolen the proposal belonged to the Hyde family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting another second, Arabella spun on her heel and strode toward the building&#39;s entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny&#39;s voice echoed behind her in the cavernous lobby. &#34;Wait, Daisy, where do you think you&#39;re going? They&#39;ll never let you past security!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had arrived with his father but had been relegated to waiting outside like a discarded afterthought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the polished lobby, Arabella encountered Dominick, whose eyebrows lifted in genuine surprise. &#34;Miss Stanley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would it be possible to speak with Asher?&#34;Arabella asked, though hesitation colored her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Certainly. Please allow me to escort you,&#34;Dominick replied with professional courtesy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ascended to the thirtieth floor in comfortable silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gordon is currently engaged in client negotiations,&#34; Dominick explained as they reached their destination. &#34;Please make yourself comfortable in his office, Miss Stanley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella felt urgency building like pressure in her chest. She had been unaware of Gracie&#39;s competitor&#39;s identity before, and now everything made perfect sense. The Hydes, with their documented history of unethical business</p>
                
                
                
                <p>practices, had undoubtedly stolen the proposal.Perhaps she could present the truth directly to Asher and change the outcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there something troubling you, Miss Stanley?&#34;Dominick inquired, noticing the tension that had settled across Arabella&#39;s features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella pressed her lips together, preparing to respond when the conference room doors swung open and Asher emerged. His imposing figure commanded immediate attention, while his chiseled features remained carved from stone.The moment his gaze found Arabella, surprise flickered briefly in his eyes. His voice resonated with authority when he spoke. &#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracie appeared close behind him, her expression broadcasting defeat-clearly the meeting had concluded disastrously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside Gracie stood a man. Arabella assumed that he might be Kenny&#39;s father, Hayden Hyde,whose face bore the same dissatisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden addressed Asher with forced politeness.&#34;Mr. Gordon, I sincerely hope we&#39;ll have opportunities to collaborate in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher didn&#39;t acknowledge Hayden&#39;s existence,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>prompting the older man to depart with wounded pride burning in his wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you want something?&#34; Asher inquired,his penetrating gaze noting Arabella&#39;s continued silence with growing curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have reason to believe the Hydes plagiarized the proposal. I&#39;m personally acquainted with their family&#39;s character. Mr. Hyde&#39;s son terrorized my sister in school,&#34; Arabella explained, her voice gaining strength with each word. &#34;They&#39;ve built their reputation on questionable business practices and outright theft.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, Arabella retrieved her phone,prepared to present the evidence she had gathered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracie felt her heart warm at Arabella&#39;s fierce loyalty,though despair continued to weigh heavily on her spirit. Asher&#39;s reputation for inflexibility was legendary-he had never bent his principles for anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True to his nature, Asher responded, &#34;I understand your concerns. There&#39;s no need to show me your evidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gracie&#39;s heart plummeted toward her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope had been nothing more than a cruel illusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher never made exceptions, regardless of circumstances or compelling arguments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his worldview, the person who allowed their plans to be stolen bore equal responsibility/with the actual thief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Return tomorrow morning,&#34; Asher said, his attention shifting to Gracie.</p>
