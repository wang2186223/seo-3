                <p>A.S. let out a nonchalant sigh, her words lazy.&#34;Deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe&#39;s lips curled with satisfaction. She was barely able to hide her excitement as their singing duel kicked off. &#34;So what&#39;s the plan? Duet, or are we going solo?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Either way. Doesn&#39;t bother me.&#34; Still unfazed,A.S.shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assuming A.S. was just fronting, Khloe couldn&#39;t resist pushing further. &#34;Let&#39;s make it a duet,then.Got any favorites?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, A.S.waved a hand. &#34;You decide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe wasted no time, queuing up the song she always used to show off her range. It was a tough,high-energy piece-her specialty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room began buzzing with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone in the crowd leaned over. &#34;Isn&#39;t Khloe stacking the odds with that one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, she gave A.S. the chance to choose. If A.S.crashes and burns, it&#39;s on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A.S. is a powerhouse-just watch. She&#39;s got this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, finally! Thanks to Koko, we&#39;re getting to see A.S.really go all out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe seized the moment, belting out the song&#39;s highest, flashiest notes, leaving the onlookers wide-eyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many eyes rolled at her antics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Classic Khloe. Too scared to lose, so she grabs the spotlight for herself. What&#39;s she trying to prove?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A.S. isn&#39;t even making a fuss-so why are her followers so riled up? Are you all just here to cheerlead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clearly you&#39;re tone-deaf. A.S.&#39;s talent leaves Khloe in the dust!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fired up another reply, saying, &#34;If A.S&#39;s all that, she&#39;ll crush it-big note or not. Save the complaints for someone else!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the music began, the comments section exploded with arguments and opinions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Launching into the first verse, Khloe hit her stride and delivered her trademark performance,racking up over fifty thousand reward points</p>
                
                
                
                <p>within seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every single point represented a real dollar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Khloe&#39;s tally skyrocket, A.S.&#39;s fans could only hold their breath and watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Khloe finished, the room shifted. Suddenly,a voice floated out-warm as sunlight, tender as a breeze, carrying a hush through the entire crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, the comments vanished into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A.S.&#39;s melody wrapped around every listener, a gentle caress that soothed and captivated,threading straight through their hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like true enchantment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, A.S. limited herself to the occasional demo during coaching sessions, but this was different. Tonight, it felt like the world had been invited to her private concert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe was taken aback by A.S&#39;s performance.Only the flood of comments jolted her back into focus,but she was already a beat behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic clouded her mind, making it hard to stay on track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Praise for A.S. poured in. &#34;That&#39;s pure gold right</p>
                
                
                
                <p>there! A.S.&#39;s voice just became my new ringtone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One fan finally got it. &#34;No wonder A.S. rarely performs-after just a few notes, I&#39;m addicted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others couldn&#39;t help but gloat. &#34;Whoever doubted A.S. must be embarrassed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritationsimmered in Khloe as she watched the chat light up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, A.S. had a pretty voice-smooth,emotional,all the right elements-but it was style over substance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was being played.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When A.S.&#39;s reward points started climbing rapidly, anxiety gripped Khloe. She hurried off a text to her agent for support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Khloe was signed to a major agency-they were supposed to back her up in moments like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the chorus hit its highest note, Khloe went all out, belting with everything she had, hoping to turn the tide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her total jumped, inching past Arabella&#39;s once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,the chat flooded with enthusiastic-and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>suspiciously coordinated-support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at Koko go! A.S. is just about the pretty tone and cheap feels, but Koko&#39;s got serious talent!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As a music major, I can say for sure-Koko&#39;s technique is rock solid. That other girl? All hype,no skill!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One viewer said, &#34;I&#39;m no expert, but Koko sure sounds impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waves of paid comments began shaping the chat,and soon the casual audience was left second-guessing their own ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, out of nowhere, A.S.&#39;s vocals floated through again, snapping the crowd back into a kind of trance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered in the chat. &#34;Who are you kidding? No technique? How else is A.S. making everyone feel like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, Koko&#39;s supporters must be wearing blinders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is critical thinking just gone now? A.S.is the only one giving us real music!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A.S.&#39;s supporters grew restless. Despite her next-level talent, Khloe&#39;s reward score soared-her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>total was now double A.S.&#39;s, an eye-popping five million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With only seconds left on the clock, it looked like A.S. would walk away empty-handed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in her roomn, Arabella took in the scoreboard with unreadable calm, not a flicker of emotion crossing her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen enough to know that most of Khloe&#39;s votes were probably fueled by her agency&#39;s wallet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the platform claimed half of every dollar,agencies often got a percentage back-so those big numbers weren&#39;t as costly as they looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the last notes faded, leaving only the instrumental outro, Khloe shot a sweet smile at the camera. &#34;Well, A.S., looks like it&#39;s your turn to face the music. Care to say a few words?&#34;</p>
