                <p>Elissa broke down, unable to stop her tears. Her hatred for Arabella had never been stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not once did she stop to think that she had been the one who bullied Daisy from the very start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Elissa&#39;s eyes, Arabella was merciless,someone who deserved nothing less than the worst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan,feeling pity for Elissa, shot a glare as cold as steel and said, &#34;Maybe it&#39;s time Arabella wasn&#39;t around anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe and the others were startled at first, but the shock faded quickly. They realized that as long as Arabella was out there, their misery would never end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan pressed Bennie urgently. &#34;Can&#39;t you think of something? You have so many connections. We could handle Arabella quietly.She&#39;s just an orphan-no one would even notice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennie nodded in agreement. &#34;You&#39;re right. I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Arabella was completely unaware of the Tucker family&#39;s scheme. After sending a few messages and grabbing a quick bite, she made her way back to the private suite. Asher was already waiting by the door. &#34;You&#39;re back.I tried calling you just now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied, &#34;I didn&#39;t see it. What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s voice grew serious. &#34;Your sister is awake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s eyes widened in shock. She turned to rush for the elevator, but Asher cauught her hand.&#34;I&#39;ll go with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated. &#34;Don&#39;t you have things to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;Nothing more important than this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher led her into the elevator by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the private room, someone blurted out aloud, &#34;What&#39;s gotten Asher so flustered? I&#39;ve never seen him move so fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton paused and then answered, &#34;Let&#39;s not get involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something told him this had to do with Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another person in the group asked, &#34;By the way,has anyone seen Kaitlyn lately? I kind of miss her around here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s eyes went cold in an instant. &#34;She&#39;s busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other man just chuckled. &#34;Don&#39;t be so strict.Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll marry her when she&#39;s older!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, Colton&#39;s face showed a flash of anger. He lifted his glass and finished his drink in one quick motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glass slipped from his grasp and smashed against the floor, making everyone jump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton managed a tight smile. &#34;Sorry about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He calmly wiped his hand, then added, &#34;I have something to deal with. You all go on without me. I&#39;ll be stepping out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella hurried to Daisy&#39;s room, where Daisy sat on the bed,her gaze empty and lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daisy!&#34; Arabella&#39;s voice broke as she rushed to hug her sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of awareness lit up Daisy&#39;s face. &#34;Bella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella nodded, her eyes rimmed with tears as she gently let Daisy go. Seeing Daisy so out of it made her heart twist with pain. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry,Daisy.I should have come home sooner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy stared at her, struggling to believe it was real. &#34;You&#39;re really back,Arabella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a small nod, her voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;ve come back.&#34; Her tears poured freely as she looked at Daisy. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry for everything. You went through all that pain. This is all on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy reached out and hugged her tightly &#34;None of it was your fault, Bella. I&#39;m just happy you&#39;re home.I kept worrying you&#39;d never return.I promise I&#39;ll behave now-just please, don&#39;t leave me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s heart overflowed with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella furrowed her brow. &#34;When did I ever say I wasn&#39;t coming back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down Daisy&#39;s face, her eyes red and puffy. &#34;Aunt Meagan told me you left because I wasn&#39;t good enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of anger and sadness washed over Arabella. How could Meagan say something so cruel to her sister? No wonder Daisy always kept her struggles to herself and only shared the good moments with Arabella through the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She softened her voice. &#34;That&#39;s not true at all.I just had some important things to take care of.Now that everything is settled, I can stay right here with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s face looked even thinner than before,her eyes wide and watery as she gazed up. &#34;Are you sure? You really mean you&#39;ll stay with me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella ran her fingers gently through Daisy&#39;s hair. &#34;Absolutely. I&#39;ll be right by your side,always.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Daisy, and she buried her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>face in Arabella&#39;s shoulder. &#34;I missed you so much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warm smile touched Arabella&#39;s lips. &#34;I missed you too,Daisy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the doorway, Asher quietly watched the reunion before softly shutting the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made his way downstairs and asked the cook to prepare something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the room, a little while later, Arabella encouraged Daisy to try getting up for a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy hesitated, clearly uneasy about her injured leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice barely above a whisper, Daisy said,&#34;I don&#39;t really want to leave the bed right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella could tell what Daisy was feeling. They were twins, after all. &#34;Just try standing for a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gently helped Daisy sit up and swing her legs over the side of the bed. Daisy bit her lip as she stood, half expecting to fall, but both legs held steady beneath her.</p>
