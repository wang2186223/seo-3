                <p>Out of nowhere, relatives who hadn&#39;t bothered with Arabella in years began texting her one after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One message scolded her, &#34;How could you toss your aunt out like that, Arabella? No young woman should behave this way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another scoffed, &#34;Stop being so stubborn,Arabella.Bring your aunt home right now. You&#39;re all alone-your aunt is the only family you have left!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold sneer curled on Arabella&#39;s lips as she promptly blocked each and every one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Funny how these people, once so eager for her father&#39;s help, now took Meagan&#39;s side without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bottle after bottle disappeared, and when her supply ran dry, Arabella made her way</p>
                
                
                
                <p>downstairs, the world spinning. She collided with something solid and glanced up-her gaze met a strikingly handsome face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concern flickered across Asher&#39;s features as he caught the scent of alcohol on her breath and saw the flush on her cheeks. &#34;You&#39;ve been drinking, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft nod, Arabella let her weight rest against him, her limbs almost boneless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out to steady her. &#34;Do you think you can stand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A barely-there shiver ran through him as her skin brushed against his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her perfume mingled with the sharp tang of alcohol, creating an unexpectedly alluring blend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion clouded her expression. &#34;Who are you?&#34; The usual coldness in her features melted into something vulnerable, almost childlike.&#34;Tell me.who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring down at her, Asher felt something inside him shift-his heart, usually so guarded,softened in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A vivid memory returned to him-a rain-soaked kitten he had once rescued, looking every bit as lost as Arabella did now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wariness filled the kitten&#39;s eyes, its muddy fur clinging to its small body. Still, when he made to leave, it trailed after him, refusing to be left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bringing the little stray home, he found it grew attached, never straying far from his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sadly, the companionship didn&#39;t last-his grandfather soon cast the kitten out, ending their brief bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re Dad,&#34; Arabella whispered, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words struck Asher dumb for a moment,catching him off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever gentle feeling had crept into his heart evaporated in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, he hoisted Arabella over his shoulder with ease, carrying her to her room and placing her gently on the bed. &#34;Get some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Arabella resisted, shaking her head.Tears streamed down her face as she gazed up at him.&#34;Why did you have to go so soon, Dad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher was left without words, unsure how to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of her swollen, glistening eyes brought an ache to his chest. Quietly, he murmured, &#34;Maybe I should have found you both earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Much of Arabella&#39;s life was a mystery he had tried to unravel-she had vanished from home at twelve, and only resurfaced just as he returned himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where she had been all those years remained a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>secret he hadn&#39;t cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, something about her always hinted at hidden depths-so composed, so wise, and fiercely independent. Yet, beneath that strength, he could sense the scars left by losing her parents so young. And to think-she was only nineteen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft whisper escaped Arabella. &#34;I missed you so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand clung tightly to his, warm tears dripping onto his skin, and the touch made his fingers tremble. With gentle care, he brushed her cheek and promised in a quiet voice, saying,&#34;From this moment on, I&#39;ll protect you and your sister from all harm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained close, never leaving her side as she finally drifted off to sleep, exhaustion winning out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With patient hands, Asher pulled the blanket up around her shoulders, ensuring she was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night faded, and the first rays of morning light crept through the windows, ushering in a new day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella awoke with a pounding head and quickly/ realized she had overindulged last night.In search of relief, she made her way downstairs, only to find Asher emerging from the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked particularly striking that morning,dressed in a crisp white shirt and black vest,every detail neat and precise. He handed her a glass. &#34;Here. Drink this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grateful, Arabella accepted the water, her cheeks flushing slightly. &#34;I might have had a bit too much to drink last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He responded with a nod, not making much of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity nagged at her. &#34;I didn&#39;t do anything I&#39;ll regret, did l?&#34; She glanced up, searching his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>face for answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s expression remained steady and unreadable. &#34;Why don&#39;t you tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could say another word, he was already heading for the dining table. &#34;Let&#39;s eat.I&#39;ll give you a ride to campus after breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied that nothing embarrassing had occurred, Arabella let the matter drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once breakfast was finished, Asher drove her straight to Griridge University.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the last two days, student outrage toward Arabella had only grown louder. The tension reached a peak when Elissa arrived on campus looking fragile and sorrowful, instantly winning over her supporters. Sympathy poured in, and Joyce wasted no time organizing a crowd to rally in front of the college president&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we supposed to stand by while someone like Daisy remains at this school?&#34; Joyce asked.&#34;If we keep silent, we&#39;ll be lumped in with her by</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the time we graduate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd retorted, &#34;Absolutely not!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chants erupted. &#34;Expel Daisy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chorus rang out. &#34;Daisy has no place at Griridge University!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa intervened, seemingly trying to play peacemaker. &#34;You really don&#39;t have to go this far. Daisy&#39;s had a hard life-she lost her parents,and that&#39;s probably why she acts out...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce gave Elissa&#39;s shoulder a reassuring squeeze, but her eyes glittered with spite.&#34;Relax, Elissa. By the end of today, Daisy will be gone for good.&#34;</p>
