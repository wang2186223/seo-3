                <p>About thirty minutes later, the bodyguards brought Arabella straight into the Lambert family&#39;s estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sounds of weeping drifted toward her before she even reached the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between sobs, Joyce begged, &#34;Mom, she really went too far. You&#39;ll get rid of everything for me,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to soothe her daughter, Maryam Lambert answered, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Joyce. Everything&#39;s been wiped clean. Imagine, just a young girl, yet she had the nerve to go after you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maryam&#39;s words dripped with venom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Arabella stepped into the living room, she spotted Joyce and Maryam seated on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting next to Joyce, a woman with striking cheekbones and a commanding presence looked Arabella up and down. The coldness in her eyes left no doubt that she felt above her. Her words were biting. &#34;This is Daisy Stanley?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce responded without missing a beat, a mix of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>pride and scorn in her voice. &#34;Yes, that&#39;s her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With deliberate movements, Maryam picked up a leather whip and strode toward Arabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce felt a thrill rush through her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother was no ordinary figure in their world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus, inside these walls, Daisy had nowhere to run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thick leather wrapped around the whip. Just a single lash would easily break the skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maryam spoke in a condescending tone.&#34;You arrogant little bitch. Get down on your knees.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella refused to move, her glare as cold as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about Arabella&#39;s reaction gave Maryam pause. Years of dealing wth powerful people had made her a force to be reckoned with,but this girl wasn&#39;t the least bit intimidated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Maryam raised the whip,ready to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Arabella broke her silence. &#34;Mrs.Lambert, do you have any idea what Joyce has really done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maryam&#39;s hand froze in the air, and Arabella began to list each of Joyce&#39;s vicious acts. &#34;She and Elissa broke my leg, forced me out of my clothes in the restroom, led the others in tormenting me, even burned my skin with a curling iron...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each word came out steady and cold as Arabella named every awful thing done to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maryam listened, then slowly lowered the whip. A harsh sneer twisted her lips. &#34;And what if she did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look in Maryam&#39;s eyes was blank and uncaring as she addressed Arabella, saying, &#34;You really believe Joyce is why you&#39;re in this mess?You&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s because of who you are and who your parents are. If you were born into wealth, nothing like this would ever happen. Our family earned its status through hard work, and people like you are just here for our amusement.Even if Joyce ended your life right now, nobody would dare to stop her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dripped with venom and contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her seat, Joyce crossed her legs, smug and satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella dropped her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maryam sneered, &#34;Feeling scared now? It always takes pain to teach fools a lesson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile crossed Arabella&#39;s lips as she raised her head. &#34;Joyce hasn&#39;t faced any consequences herself, but her compromising video is already all over the Internet. Everyone&#39;s seen her naked by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage flashed across Maryam&#39;s face. &#34;You little bitch!&#34; she screamed, whipping the air furiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella leaped aside, but the bodyguards moved in without hesitation, grabbing hold of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These men were the best, handpicked for their strength and loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella fought to break free, dodging most of the blows, but still ended up with a harsh mark on her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of metal sliced through the air as Arabella stepped away from danger. Her necklace swung up, and the blade sliced clean through the chain.A crisp clatter echoed when the jewelry hit the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the pendant snapped open, it would expose a photo of Arabella with Daisy inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of determination lit up Arabella&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fought off a bodyguard with quick force,knocking him down and darting forward to snatch her necklace. Before she could pick it up, a stiletto heel smashed down on the pendant,shattering it in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heartache flared through Arabella, sharp and sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maryam&#39;s voice rang out, dripping with scorn.&#34;Seems like the more worthless a person&#39;s life is,the harder they cling to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Arabella stood frozen. That pause gave the bodyguards their opening. Several of them lunged forward and pinned her in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glare burned in Maryam&#39;s eyes as she swung the whip, her voice harsh. &#34;You filthy cunt, you deserve to die!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right before the whip struck, a sudden pain tore through Maryam&#39;s chest as a thin needle embedded itself in her skin. Agony raced through her, and she crashed to the floor, clutching her chest as the pain spread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce jumped up in a panic to help her mother. In that same moment, a group of men dressed in black stormed through the doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room exploded into chaos as the boodyguards</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fought with thenewcomers.Butsoon, the bodyguards quickly lost ground. Joyce backed away, frantically calling her father. &#34;Dad... Dad,you have to help us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella managed to fire just one needle before the men in black whisked her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried to scoop up every piece of her broken pendant as she was led out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the waiting black car, Arabella took her seat and blinked in shock when she saw Asher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at him and asked, &#34;Why are you here?&#34;</p>
