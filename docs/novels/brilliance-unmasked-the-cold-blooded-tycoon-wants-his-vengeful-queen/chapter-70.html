                <p>&#34;Hey Daisy, it&#39;s been ages since we last met!l honestly didn&#39;t think I&#39;d see you walk in here.ls this your sister with you? She&#39;s stunning,&#34; Bob said with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving closer, Bob chose the seat right next to Arabella.He casually rested his hand behind her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flashed in Daisy&#39;s eyes. &#34;Leave right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy lunged, ready to force Bob away,but Arabella reacted even faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp noise echoed as Bob howled in pain.&#34;Ah! My arm!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, the room grew quiet. Kate&#39;s eyes widened as she caught sight of Bob&#39;s arm</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hanging at his side. She quickly covered her mouth, then started screaming. &#34;Do you realize who you just hurt? How could you act like this?Once the Johnson family hears about this, you&#39;ll regret it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Johnson family? WVhy should I be worried about them?&#34; Arabella&#39;s voice was barely above a whisper as she spoke. A faint, cold smile spread across her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her bold and unbothered attitude left the room in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob eyed Arabella from head to toe and saw she wore nothing from any big labels. He snapped, his words sharp, &#34;I was being civil by talking to you, you worthless bitch. If you want to keep your place in Griridge, you&#39;d better say sorry right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy finally reached her limit. She marched over and slapped Bob&#39;s face with all her strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright red mark appeared on his cheek while he stared at Daisy, completely stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always thought Daisy was gentle. Now,she had actually hit him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The humiliation of being struck by two young women in front of so many people left Bob seething with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy glared at him, her voice rising. &#34;Don&#39;t come near my sister again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a lot of nerve,&#34; Bob said through clenched teeth, his glare sharp. &#34;You seem to forget how much influence I have in this city.You and your sister will find no place in Griridge.Mark my words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from his seat, Bob yelled at Kate, &#34;Get them out of here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puffing herself up, Kate shot the sisters a smug look. &#34;Fuck off right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cold stare, Arabella retorted, &#34;| didn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>realize Eclat let salespeople decide which customers to kick out,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eclat doesn&#39;t serve people who only come in to browse without buying anything,&#34; Kate said,folding her arms and staring them down wvith clear hostility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A worried look settled on Ruth&#39;s face. She turned toward Kate and remarked, &#34;Kate, this isn&#39;t right. You know our policy says we have to treat every customer with respect at all times.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dismissive snort, Kate replied, &#34;That rule is for actual customers. Do those two even look like they&#39;re planning to buy anything? They&#39;ve just been wasting time, trying on outfits with no plans to make a purchase.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob fixed a nasty grin on Arabella and Daisy,then said mockingly, &#34;So, you two want these outfits? Spend one night with me, and I&#39;ll buy every single one for you. How about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although anger simmered in him, he still</p>
                
                
                
                <p>couldn&#39;t take his eyes off their faces, letting his desire take over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy didn&#39;t hesitate. She spit straight into Bob&#39;s face and shouted, &#34;You&#39;re disgusting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, angry wipe crossed Bob&#39;s face, his hand shaking from fury. &#34;All right then! I&#39;ll take every piece they tried on. Bag them up now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she heard that, Kate&#39;s face broke into a bright smile. &#34;Of course, Mr. Johnson! Right away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed up to Daisy and yanked at her dress. &#34;What are you standing around for? Get those clothes off before you mess them up.Let&#39;s be real, even if we put you up for sale, you still couldn&#39;t afford them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing tall, Arabella reached out, seized Kate&#39;s hand, and shoved her to the side. Kate nearly lost her balance as Arabella stared her down. &#34;Who said you could touch my sister?And for your information, we&#39;re not done with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>these outfits. If he wants them, he&#39;ll just have to wait until we&#39;re finished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The frustration on Kate&#39;s face grew even stronger, and she snapped, &#34;You could never afford anything here. Don&#39;t waste everyone&#39;s time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing to ignore Kate completely, Arabella turned her attention to Daisy and said softly,&#34;Take your time. Try on more if you like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Kate could make another move, Ruth quickly intervened and said, &#34;Hang on, Kate.Why don&#39;t you go and see if Mr. Johnson needs help with something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kate sneered, &#34;You really are clueless, Ruth.Can&#39;t you see they have nothing? Those two nobodies won&#39;t help you reach your sales goals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she was full of contempt, Kate couldn&#39;t bring herself to yank the clothes away and was forced to guide Bob elsewhere to look at other</p>
                
                
                
                <p>pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain throbbed in Bob&#39;s arm, yet he stood his ground and would not budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed put, eager to see the sisters embarrassed once they couldn&#39;t afford to pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ten minutes, Daisy finished changing out of the outfits. Arabella, looking pleased, picked out several handbags for her to try as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With narrowed eyes, Kate let her sarcasm show.&#34;You&#39;re still here? Seems like the less people have, the more they want to flaunt it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob kept his eyes on the pair, silently anticipating their downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella turned to Ruth and said, &#34;Please wrap all of these up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Ruth was caught off guard. &#34;Of course. I&#39;ll ring up your purchases right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock on Kate and Bob&#39;s faces was impossible to miss. Kate quickly sneered, &#34;Oh,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>so the act continues? As if you&#39;d ever pay for any of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob&#39;s mind echoed the same doubt. He truly believed the sisters were bluffing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruth checked the register, then remarked, &#34;The total comes to $1.2 million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Arabella a quick,uneasy glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Arabella produced a credit card and handed it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The polished black card caught the light,making it clear that this was something special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the room froze, too stunned to react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not just any card. Only five hundred of these black cards existed, reserved for those at the highest level of society.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kate finally found her voice after a moment of disbelief and said, &#34;You must be joking. As if anyone could just pull out a centurion card-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Kate could finish, the machine beeped.The payment went through. Ruth handed the card back with a polite smile and began wrapping the items.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than a million spent in a single transaction...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of dizziness washed over Kate. Was this girl really that wealthy?</p>
