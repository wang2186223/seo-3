                <p>Arabella and Daisy started searching every inch of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some time, their efforts turned up nothing.Frustration creased Arabella&#39;s brow. Had her father really left no trace behind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wandered back into his old room, eyes landing on the bookshelf coated in dust. Her hand reached out instinctively as she recalled how her father used to read books in this very spot, long before he ever dreamed of founding his own company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as Arabella&#39;s fingers skimmed the surface,she felt something off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though it looked like plain wood, the material beneath was solid, almost like it was reinforced with something bulletproof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of bookshelf needed that kind of protection?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella immediately began inspecting every inch. Seeing her intensity, Daisy joined in to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t long before Arabella&#39;s hand found a spot that felt out of place, a possible switch. She pressed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a faint click broke the silence, and the bookshelf began to turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hidden passageway appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement sparked between Arabella and Daisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They headed straight in, lighting their way with their phones, and soon found themselves in a basement filled with all sorts of unfamiliar equipment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;What is all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy looked completely lost, but Arabella recognized every piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These were the same devices she used in her lab.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Discovering such advanced technology in her father&#39;s basement left Arabella completely stunned. &#34;We need to find anything my dad left behind. We don&#39;t have much time before Vanessa comes back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They quickly uncovered a stack of his books.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no time to examine them, they hurried back downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vanessa and Meagan returned from her walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, the older you get, the more important it is to take a stroll after meals. Otherwise, your food just sits there,&#34; Vanessa said cheerfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan poured on the praise. &#34;Mom, you&#39;re doing better than anyone your age. Those older women out in the countryside have nothing on you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, don&#39;t lump me in with the likes of them,&#34;Vanessa sneered, her gaze sharp with cunning.&#34;I&#39;m certain Arabella and Daisy have already come around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved into the living room, and sure enough, found Arabella and Daisy standing there with downcast eyes, looking appropriately remorseful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan&#39;s heart swelled with satisfaction. At last,these two little rebels were acting properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vanessa settled into the sofa and asked, &#34;So,how did everything turn out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella replied calmly, &#34;Grandma, I think your reasoning makes a lot of sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pleased smile appeared on Vanessa&#39;s lips. &#34;You really are the most sensible one, Arabella.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But since my father wasn&#39;t actually your son,shouldn&#39;t this house go back to us? All those years, my dad supported you financially. That should be more than enough repayment for raising him.&#34; Arabella lifted her chin, her face giving nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit Vanessa like a slap. She stared at Arabella, completely stunned. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were just a country woman before my father gave you this house. If he wasn&#39;t your real son,isn&#39;t it only fair that you give us back what belongs to him?&#34; Arabella answered, her tone flat,almost cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vanessa never expected this kind of defiance and was shaking with anger. &#34;How dare you talk to me like that, you ungrateful girl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan jumped in, voice rising, &#34;Are you out of your mind, Arabella? If it wasn&#39;t for my mom, your</p>
                
                
                
                <p>dad would have already dead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Without my father, you&#39;d still be stuck working in an electronics factory, isn&#39;t that right?&#34; Arabella let out a quiet, mocking laugh as she looked at Meagan. &#34;Without him, your whole family would be living the country life you claim to hate. So really, who&#39;s come out ahead here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Vanessa was so furious she could barely catch her breath. Meagan rushed to give her some medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Arabella and Daisy rose from their seats. Arabella said, &#34;Grandma, you can stop buying that cheap coffee to act sophisticated. It tastes awful, and you clearly have no clue about quality.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she and Daisy took their leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That jab nearly sent Vanessa over the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she regained her composure, Vanessa swore. &#34;Ungrateful brats! I wish they&#39;d never been born!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, I keep telling you, those two are a lost cause.&#34; Meagan added as she tried to soothe her,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what if Arabella refuses to hand over the house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa, speaking quietly, said, &#34;Honestly, I think Arabella&#39;s already crossed a line she can&#39;t come back from.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meagan shot her a look. &#34;What are you getting at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa explained, &#34;Nobody has patience for disrespectful children anymore. Arabella&#39;s only making things worse for herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe jumped in, her tone bright. &#34;Exactly! Now we get to keep the house and don&#39;t owe a dime! lt was always meant to be ours!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she knew Arabella&#39;s father wasn&#39;t related by blood, Khloe felt a sudden confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pictured herself breezing through her next live stream, without a trace of worry about being called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That smug feeling lasted until her hand brushed the scars on her face, her mood instantly soured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the Gracebourne house, Arabella and Daisy wasted no time digging into their father&#39;s notebooks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher had already left for work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Page by page, their father&#39;s words painted a vivid picture. His nagging doubts about his true background, right up until the moment he learned he wasn&#39;t related to the Stanley family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The notes went on to describe the moment everything changed between him and their grandparents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one entry, he wrote. &#34;I want to marry Sylvia Herington. She&#39;s a good person, strong and principled, just like me. But my parents refuse to accept her and keep pushing Nora Royale. I won&#39;t back down. After marrying Sylvia, their disapproval only grew. Eventually, we moved out.&#34;</p>
