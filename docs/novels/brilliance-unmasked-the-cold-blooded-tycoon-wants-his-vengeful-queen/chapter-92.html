                <p>This was the moment when everything shifted between their father and his parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what had driven their grandparents to push so hard for him to marry Nora? And who was Nora,really?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that there was a bigger story, so she reached out to Joshua for help digging deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Daisy kept turning the pages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next few diary entries were filled with their father&#39;s joy at their arrival and described how life moved along quietly for a while. Then came a long gap, an entire month with no writing at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the diary picked up again, the words were heavy. &#34;I never thought I&#39;d learn that Sylvia was actually... Fate really does play tricks! What am l supposed to do now? What about the kids? I need to be ready. My situation doesn&#39;t matter, but the children are still so little-it&#39;s heartbreaking.I&#39;m sorry to all of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was where the diary ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever came after &#34;Sylvia was actually...&#34; had been completely blacked out, hiding the truth from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daisy finished reading, her eyes filled with tears. &#34;Do you think Dad knew the end was coming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems like it. And Mom must be important,&#34;Arabella said,her mind racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think someone wanted them dead?&#34;Daisy asked, worry coloring her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s voice dropped. &#34;That&#39;s what it looks like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Joshua replied with the information he had dug up. Tracing Nora&#39;s identity had been simple. She turned out to be the daughter of a distant branch of Arabella&#39;s grandfather, and about the same age as their dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Arabella was left wondering. Why had her grandfather been so insistent? Nora seemed perfectly unremarkable, while their own mother had been extraordinary-gentle, strong,everything anyone could admire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma must have known who Dad really was,&#34;Arabella said coldly. &#34;There&#39;s no other reason for them to break up his marriage just to pair him with Nora.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy glanced at the message on Arabella&#39;s screen. &#34;That means Dad&#39;s background is a big deal too... but we&#39;re totally in the dark.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella thought for a moment. &#34;If anyone knows the truth, it&#39;s probably Grandma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, a new message popped up. &#34;How&#39;s it going,Bella? Want any help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bella?!&#34; Daisy exclaimed, her eyes going wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered, Arabella&#39;s cheeks turned red. &#34;It&#39;s just a nickname, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, Daisy clung to Arabella&#39;s hand. &#34;You can&#39;t start dating Asher this soon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella sighed, then changed the subject.&#34;Anyway, I&#39;ll talk to Asher. His dad knew ours-maybe he can help us find something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy agreed with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella headed for the study and filled Asher in on what she had found in the diary, deciding there was no reason to keep secrets anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, he was on her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher spoke thoughtfully. &#34;I remember my father mentioning yours once. He said your dad never belonged in that family, but I didn&#39;t press him for details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression darkened, and his tone grew heavy. &#34;Both of our fathers died so abruptly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella hesitated, then asked gently, &#34;Can I ask   11</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher continued, &#34;My father carried a bullet from the war. The doctors said taking it out would kill him, but living with it caused him endless pain. In the end, he couldn&#39;t hold on and passed away just a few months after your father. Those last months, his mind was fading. Otherwise, I know he would have tried to get in touch with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Asher&#39;s face remained calm, there was a note of sadness in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the time, he had been stationed with the military and only managed one final visit before his father was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella reached for his hands, her touch gentle and comforting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His skin was cool to the touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taken aback, Asher noticed how her gentle warmth seeped into his skin, and he instinctively gave her hands a reassuring squeeze. In that silent exchange, the two of them found complete understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steely determination settled in Arabella&#39;s eyes.&#34;I will find out who&#39;s responsible for my parents&#39;deaths.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not alone. I&#39;ll help you every step of the way,&#34; Asher assured her, his gaze unwavering.Suddenly, a thought struck him. &#34;Your mother&#39;s maiden name is Herington, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is. Why?&#34; Arabella answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Herington family in Ockford are shrouded in mystery. They aren&#39;t counted among the city&#39;s richest, but almost every member holds some position in government or wields serious influence. Even the top elite families can&#39;t match their power,&#34; Asher said with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella nodded slowly. She had heard whispers about the Herington family, but rarely crossed paths with them as they always seemed to move in different circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be possible that her mother had ties to Herington family?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear she would need to make a trip to Ockford if she wanted answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should get some rest,&#34; Asher told her gently,his usually frosty gaze warmed by concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella nodded in agreement. &#34;You too, Asher.Don&#39;t push yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started to head for the door, but Asher&#39;s hands lingered, refusing to let her go right away.Only after a gentle tug did she manage to slip free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving the study, she couldn&#39;t help the small smile that crept onto her lips. Until she nearly bumped into Daisy waiting in the hallway.&#34;Daisy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I stay in your room tonight?&#34; Daisy asked as she looked up, with hope shining in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s answer came without hesitation.&#34;Absolutely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy&#39;s grin was so bright as she latched onto Arabella&#39;s arm. &#34;I knew you wouldn&#39;t say no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as they walked away, Daisy&#39;s cheerful mask slipped for just a second, her expression clouded with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously? Bellawas smiling jusi becauseC Asher? That was so irritating!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few days later Arabella fianlly opened her restaurant.narming it Avalon</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening day was a huge success, with plenty of guests streaming in for a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella moved through the space, making sure every detail was perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when she caught sight of Rosie by the window.</p>
