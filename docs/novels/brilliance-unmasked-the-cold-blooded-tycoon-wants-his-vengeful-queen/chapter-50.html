                <p>Elissa let out a frustrated sigh. &#34;The company hasn&#39;t picked up any new projects lately. How are we supposed to pay Arabella back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe hesitated for a moment,then blurted out the truth about losing to A.S. The moment Elissa heard it, her expression shifted. &#34;Are you serious? Why didn&#39;t you just say no?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe&#39;s shoulders slumped. &#34;If I refused, my influencer career would be over. Everyone online would turn against me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s patience ran thin. &#34;So you think your online popularity matters more than the company actually staying afloat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe could only lower her head, unable to argue back. Elissa&#39;s voice grew firm. &#34;You&#39;ll need to come up with the money on your own.Don&#39;t expect to use any of the family&#39;s funds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Khloe opened her mouth to protest, but Meagan interjected, &#34;You&#39;re nowhere near as sharp as Elissa. Right now, all you care about is</p>
                
                
                
                <p>your own career? If the company collapses, the whole family loses everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Khloe felt wronged, she realized they were right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the thought of being mocked online for everyone to see was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration boiled inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the Gracebourne villa, Arabella stepped out of her room at the same moment Asher exited the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a gentle greeting. &#34;Hi, Asher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her with a soft reply. &#34;Hey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It surprised Arabella to catch a hint of irritation on his face. She wondered what could have put Asher in such a mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked, &#34;Is something on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered with a shrug, &#34;A little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella hesitated, but spoke up. &#34;If you want to talk about it, maybe I can help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Asher could answer, his phone rang</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick&#39;s voice came through the line. &#34;Mr.Gordon, Ms. Hudson insists you pick her up yourself. Should I go instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of Ms. Hudson immediately caught Arabella&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one Hudson family of real significance, and their status trailed just a bit behind the Gordon family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher replied with icy calm, &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ended the call without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabela felt a bit uncomfortable after overhearing the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed clear the Hudson girl was acting out,but Asher had no patience for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella guessed his mood probably had something to do with relationship troubles. She decided not to say more and was about to leave,when Asher asked, &#34;Are you busy the day after tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella took a moment to think it over. The day after tomorrow was set aside for the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>second-to-last move in her plan for revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, her schedule would be clear by the time evening rolled around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I have anything planned,&#34; she answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher met her eyes. &#34;Would you come to a banquet with me? You won&#39;t have to do anything special-just enjoy the evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you need me there,&#34; Arabella responded,hesitating for a moment, &#34;I&#39;ll come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of a smile crossed Asher&#39;s face, his deep voice as calm as ever. &#34;Great.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her, his expression much gentler than before. &#34;Get some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella returned to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, she got up early to get ready for dance practice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming out of her room, she found Asher sitting on the sofa. He wore a vest and looked especially sharp and handsome as he read the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>newspaper.Sunlight poured in through the tall windows,casting a golden glow over him. He looked every bit the classic gentleman, as if he belonged in an old movie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her stare, Asher set the paper aside and said, &#34;You&#39;re awake. Let&#39;s eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sat facing each other over breakfast,quietly sharing the space. Arabella glanced at him now and then, a strange feeling curling in her chest, something she couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher caught her eyes and asked, &#34;What&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was softer than usual, his expression calm and open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella gave a small smile and replied softly,&#34;It&#39;s nothing. I just realized it&#39;s been ages since I&#39;ve actually shared a meal with someone like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of warmth washed over her, reminding her what it felt like to be part of a family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had lost her parents young and left home</p>
                
                
                
                <p>early. Life had always been a steady grind of work and little else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher could not guess her thoughts, but a gentle smile tugged at his lips and his voice came out low and steady. &#34;You&#39;ll get used to this kind of life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella muttered to herself, &#34;Will l?&#34; The warmth from the milk left her feeling unexpectedly comforted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once breakfast ended, Asher drove her to the Griridge Opera House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the show coming up soon, rehearsals only became more demanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah tried every trick to catch Arabella in a mistake,but Arabella&#39;s dancing was flawless. By the end of the day, Lailah was fuming, unable to find a single fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That Daisy.How infuriating!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah could hardly contain her frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not the only one watching Arabella&#39;s every move. Elissa had been paying close attention too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Arabella walked off the stage, she spotted Elissa waiting nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s face looked sour. She had hoped Arabella would slip up on stage and lose her spot,but there were no mistakes to use against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arabella.&#34; Elissa took a deep breath. &#34;You&#39;re not even a dance student. Stepping on stage will only embarrass yourself. Do you really want to drag Daisy&#39;s name down with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella arched her brow. &#34;If you&#39;re not worried about making a fool of yourself with your dancing,why should I be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa was so upset she nearly choked on her words. This infuriating girl!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She triedto compose herself, forcing her tone to be calm. &#34;Let me take your place,&#34; Elissa suggested. &#34;Name your price. I&#39;ll pay you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa was desperate for this performance to revive her own reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s face stayed blank. &#34;Maybe pay me back for everything you sold from my house first,&#34; she said, then walked right past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa spun around and called out, &#34;Arabella! My grandmother raised your father for so many years. You can&#39;t just be this cold to us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella paused mid-step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not this story again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s lips curled into a sneer, her gaze full of pride. &#34;The truth is, I only learned recently that your father was not even my grandmother&#39;s real son. Even so, she still took him in. If it weren&#39;t for my grandmother, your father would be nothing, and you wouldn&#39;t even exist!&#34;</p>
