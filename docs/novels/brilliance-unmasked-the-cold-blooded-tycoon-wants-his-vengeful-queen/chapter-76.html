                <p>Elissa had scattered people throughout the crowd,all with the job of causing trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella stood to gain nothing from this.Once everything played out, she and Daisy would both be left facing harsh criticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Arabella&#39;s shocked expression, Elissa felt even more pleased with herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look on Arabella&#39;s face was genuine surprise, but she was truly caught off guard by the sudden arrival of the bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes moved from one bodyguard to another, and she quickly noted their impressive skill. These were most likely Asher&#39;s men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toward the back of the room, Asher was seated,impossible to miss with the authority he carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smirk formed on Arabella&#39;s lips. When her gaze passed over the agitators in the crowd,a flash of icy contempt lit up her eyes. &#34;Elissa must have paid you all quite a bit, considering how determined you are to stir things up for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; The troublemakers tried to hide their discomfort, but their shouting only grew louder. &#34;Now that your plot has been exposed, you&#39;re accusing us?How ridiculous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t sure before, but hearing that makes it clear you&#39;re just trying to set them up! I have never even met Elissa!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as the troublemakers kept making a scene, Arabella refused to argue with them any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa tried to savor her little victory, but a voice from behind made her stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow. Daisy, those dance moves aren&#39;t bad at</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LU</p>
                
                
                
                <p>all. Are you planning to audition for the Griridge Troupe now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa turned around and saw that a video had started playing on the big screen. In the footage, she was with two classmates, and Daisy was front and center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy kept her head bowed, her whole body shaking. Anger flashed across her face,but there was nothing she could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Joyce&#39;s voice on the recording, and she was obviously the one behind the camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Joyce spoke, Daisy whispered, &#34;What do you want from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lift your head! Stop looking so pathetic!&#34;Joyce exclaimed, yanking Daisy by the hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The video kept Daisy&#39;s face hidden, as Arabella had made sure her identity would not be revealed to the public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa pressed her lips together before finally</p>
                
                
                
                <p>saying, &#34;Don&#39;t be so rough, Joyce. You&#39;re scaring her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, Elissa, you&#39;re just too soft. This bitch is after your spot, and you still feel sorry for her?&#34; Joyce said, clearly annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But... she looks miserable too,&#34; Elissa said, her voice faltering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miserable? She&#39;s faking it. People like her always get what&#39;s coming,&#34; Joyce sneered.&#34;Daisy, this is your last warning. Drop out of the troupe auditions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not quitting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little bitch!&#34; Joyce snapped, lifting her hand to slap Daisy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa quickly caught Joyce&#39;s arm. &#34;Joyce,stop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa then took Daisy&#39;s hands in her own and tried to reason with her. &#34;Please just listen to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy tried to break free, and the next thing anyone saw, Elissa was holding onto her shoulders, and Daisy went crashing to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footage made it clear that Elissa had used force when she grabbed Daisy&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daisy tumbled all the way down the stairs, and a pool of blood quickly formed around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God! Is she even alive?&#34; both classmates asked, their voices shaking with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sounded rattled as she spoke up. &#34;No way! Daisy&#39;s always been tough. There&#39;s no way she could really be dead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should we call the police?&#34; one classmate asked, her voice filled with anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa pressed her lips together, worry in her eyes. &#34;But if we do, everyone will think this was our fault...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget her. We need to get out of here,&#34; Joyce suggested, her voice sharp with panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was where the video stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, silence filled the room before it erupted in outrage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s sick! And there are still people defending Elissa? I saw her push Daisy with my own eyes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Disgusting! She&#39;s nothing but a manipulator!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has to apologize!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s attempted murder!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The anger swirling in the room was almost too much to take in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa sat in stunned disbelief. How could this happen? How did Arabella get her hands on that video?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her first instinct was to look straight at Joyce.Only Joyce should have had a copy of the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>recording.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce looked just as shaken, her face drained of color. &#34;This can&#39;t be real... How did you get this video?&#34;</p>
