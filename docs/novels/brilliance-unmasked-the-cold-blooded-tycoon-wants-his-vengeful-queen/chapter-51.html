                <p>In Elissa&#39;s mind, Arabella remained nothing more than an orphan. How dared she display such arrogance?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep resentment churned within Elissa&#39;s chest.She had exposed the truth, anticipating the moment when Arabella would crumble into helplessness, yet Arabella&#39;s pretty face remained unmoved, her gaze growing even icier as it settled on Elissa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your parents have passed, Arabella. The responsibilities your father abandoned now fall to you,&#34; Elissa declared with cold satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How inconvenient for me,&#34; Arabella murmured,her voice carrying silk-wrapped steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s lips curved into a cruel smile. &#34;You&#39;d better consider this carefully. My grandmother raised your father. You cannot treat me with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>such disrespect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what of everything my father sacrificed for your grandmother? From what I remember, it was my father who elevated your family beyond their station. If gratitude is owed, it flows inthe opposite direction. Without him, your entire family would still be gutting fish at the market.&#34;Arabella&#39;s soft laughter delivered the humiliation like a blade wrapped in velvet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s face burned crimson as buried memories clawed their way to the surface-helping her parents at the market after school,the perpetual stench of fish clinging to her clothes, the cruel laughter of her classmates echoing in her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands balled into fists, hatred blazing in her eyes as she watched Arabella&#39;s retreating figure, when suddenly someone&#39;s fingers brushed her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa spun around, her breath catching in surprise.&#34;Lailah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I overheard your entire conversation, Elissa.My heart breaks for you. Your dancing surpasses Arabella&#39;s in every way. I cannot fathom why she received the selection instead of you.&#34;Lailah&#39;s voice dripped with manufactured sympathy for Elissa&#39;s plight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, someone understood her pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa&#39;s expression softened as she regarded Lailah with newfound warmth. &#34;True, but my hands are tied now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah leaned closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. &#34;Our troupe has always prized character above all else. I can see through her facade, but the others remain blind.If only everyone could witness her true nature.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elissa found herself nodding in complete agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lailah&#39;s hand squeezed Elissa&#39;s shoulder with calculated comfort. &#34;I heard tomorrow brings your school&#39;s anniversary celebration. Quite the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>gathering, limagine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something dangerous flickered in Elissa&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a crowded, vibrant event would provide the perfect stage for exposure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella remained oblivious to their brewing conspiracy. She made her way to observe Karlie&#39;s practice session. With the performance approaching, the backup dancers had accepted their fate and begun coasting through rehearsals, but Karlie continued pushing herself relentlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the point of exhausting yourself like this? Our moment will never come,&#34; someone muttered with bitter resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie straightened her shoulders, determination radiating from her stance. &#34;As long as I pour my heart into this work, I believe recognition will find me eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re living in a fantasy. Without the right connections, getting chosen remains nearly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>impossible.&#34; The dancer sighed heavily before abandoning the studio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your improvement has been remarkable,&#34;Arabella said as she stepped through the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie&#39;s face lit up with genuine joy upon seeing Arabella. &#34;You came! I didn&#39;t expect you tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, let me show you a few techniques that will make all the difference,&#34; Arabella replied,her voice carrying quiet authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the studio empty except for them, Arabella began demonstrating intricate movements for Karlie&#39;s benefit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After another grueling hour of practice,darkness had settled over the city when they finally departed the dance studio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The streets stretched before them, nearly deserted in the late hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Karlie mounted her bicycle and pedaled toward home. Arabella was preparing to summon a taxi when she noticed a familiar Rolls-Royce parked in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the night sky, the luxury vehicle appeared both mysterious and elegant, like something from a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Arabella approached, the tinted window descended smoothly. In the dim interior lighting,Asher&#39;s striking features emerged from the shadows, his gaze finding hers as he spoke with quiet command.&#34;Get in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella slipped into the seat beside him,settling into the leather with practiced ease.&#34;Were you simply passing through this area tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something like that,&#34; he replied, his tone giving nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella accepted his vague response and leaned back against the seat&#39;s embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had pushed herself hard during practice today, and sleep had eluded her last night.Dominick&#39;s expert driving created a gentle rhythm, and she soon found herself drifting off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher was reviewing important documents when he felt an unexpected weight settling against his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he saw the exhaustion etched across her features, an unfamiliar ache twisted in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was only nineteen years old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her age, she should be discovering joy in simple pleasures, not carrying such heavy burdens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher had just closed his laptop when Arabella&#39;s head slipped lower, coming to rest against his lap. She seemed to find comfort in this position, stretching languidly before settling into an even deeper slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick had grown accustomed to witnessing such intimate moments by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gordon, forgive me for asking, but...&#34;Dominick hesitated, then pressed forward with careful words. &#34;If you truly harbor feelings for Miss Stanley, are you still planning to proceed with the engagement to Miss Hudson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both the Gordons and the Hudsons possessed immense wealth, and both families dreamed of cementing their alliance through marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s expression hardened like winter stone.&#34;I&#39;m only providing care for Arabella because of my father&#39;s wishes. Nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick chose silence as his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found such claims impossible to believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s gaze drifted down to watch Arabella curl into herself, apparently feeling the evening&#39;s chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slipped his jacket from his shoulders and draped it over her sleeping form. The black suit jacket engulfed her petite frame, making her appear even smaller and more vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick found Asher&#39;s earlier denial even more unconvincing now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wondered if Asher himself believed the lies he was telling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick&#39;s voice returned to its professional cadence. &#34;Griridge University has extended an invitation for you to attend their anniversary celebration tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Griridge University held significance beyond Asher&#39;s alma mater status-he had poured substantial investment into the institution over the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher considered this for a brief moment before responding. &#34;I&#39;ll attend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick nearly rolled his eyes at the predictable response. The question had been merely a formality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car glided smoothly through the night toward home. Arabella remained lost in sleep,so Asher gathered her into his arms and carried</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed her gently on the bed and drew the covers up to her chin with careful precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he turned to leave, Arabella&#39;s fingers suddenly closed around his hand. Her touch was warm and soft, yet possessed surprising strength. She pulled him downward, and he nearly tumbled onto the bed beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued sleeping, her breath creating warm whispers against his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher found himself studying her exquisite features, his gaze traveling downward to her lips -bright red and impossibly soft in the dim light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, he became aware of his own heartbeat thundering in his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad... Mom...&#34; Arabella whispered through her dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The romantic spell shattered instantly. Asher&#39;s expression transformed, becoming cold and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>controlled once more. He attempted to extract his hand from her grip, but she refused to release him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t leave me.&#34; Arabella&#39;s voice carried a hoarse quality, threaded with the ghost of unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher froze, her words stopping him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long moment of internal struggle, he whispered into the darkness, &#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere.&#34;</p>
