                <p>Gracie stood frozen, her mind struggling to process what she had just witnessed. Had she actually heard correctly? She watched in stunned silence as Asher&#39;s imposing figure disappeared through the president&#39;s office doors, his cold demeanor leaving an unsettling chill in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Arabella, her expression glazed with disbelief. &#34;Mr. Gordon actually said yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick&#39;s smile radiated warmth as he nodded.&#34;Absolutely. We&#39;d like you here tomorrow to hammer out the specifics.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella&#39;s eyes sparkled with triumph. &#34;You pulled it off,Mrs.Pearson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t wrap my head around this.&#34; Gracie shook her head, bewildered. &#34;Everyone painted Mr.Gordon as this impossible man to work with.Where did all those stories even come from?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sometimes you have to take the leap to discover what&#39;s waiting on the other side,&#34; Arabella replied, her voice carrying quiet wisdom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed with gratitude, Gracie swept Arabella into a fierce embrace, pulling her close until Arabella&#39;s cheeks flushed crimson. She gently extracted herself from Gracie&#39;s enthusiastic grip. &#34;You&#39;ve got more pressing matters to handle now, Mrs. Pearson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding flashed across Gracie&#39;s face,and her expression hardened with determination.&#34;You&#39;re absolutely right. Someone&#39;s going to answer for sabotaging my proposal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Gracie departed, Arabella lingered behind and slipped into Asher&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The opulent space seemed to amplify Asher&#39;s commanding presence, surrounding him with an aura of sophistication that spoke of generations of refined breeding and power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gordon,&#34; she began tentatively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked up from his papers, irritation flickering across his features. &#34;I&#39;m not signing your paychecks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat crept up her neck as she realized her mistake. Being in his corporate domain had triggered the formal address without thinking.&#34;Asher?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in his shoulders eased slightly, and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>something softer flickered behind his guarded expression, though his voice remained glacial.&#34;Have those campus rumors been dealt with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything&#39;s settled now. Your decision to implement real-name verification on the scho0forum made my job infinitely easier.&#34; A genuine smile curved her lips, transforming her features into something almost ethereal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something stirred in his chest before he deliberately looked away. &#34;Gracie&#39;s situation is handled as well. Was there something else you needed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing more. I just wanted to express my gratitude.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Save your thanks. If she lacked competence,l wouldn&#39;t have given her the opportunity,&#34; he replied with characteristic bluntness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have complete faith she&#39;ll exceed your expectations. I&#39;ve watched her work since I was a little girl-she&#39;s got an instinct for business that&#39;s almost supernatural,&#34; Arabella said, her voice carrying deep conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; His response came clipped and final, as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wry get out of your way then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella had barely taken two steps when his voice stopped her cold.&#34;Are you heading home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me ten minutes. I&#39;ll head back too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I brought my own car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dominick can handle yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused mid-stride, somethingin his tone making her reconsider. After a moment&#39;s hesitation, she settled onto the leather sofa to wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she sat down, Daisy&#39;s phone buzzed against her leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella had taken Daisy&#39;s device to better understand her situation, though she had no intention of violating her privacy by reading personal messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The text was from Kenny. &#34;Just say the word and I&#39;m there,baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The saccharine endearment made her skin crawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fired back, &#34;Maybe channel that energy into saving your family&#39;s company from bankruptcy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenny&#39;s responses came rapid-fire. &#34;Our company&#39;s thriving!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t I mention? We&#39;re about to seal a partnership with the Gordon Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t stress-you&#39;re still the one who has my heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a jerk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella pocketed the phone, her attention shifting to Asher as he pressed his fingers against his temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours hunched over documents had clearly taken their toll, leaving him drained and tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose and approached him from behind. The instant her hand made contact with his shoulder,he seized her wrist with crushing force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spun around, and at the sight of Arabella, he immediately loosened his grip. &#34;My apologies.Occupational hazard.What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You looked exhausted. I know some massage techniques that might help,&#34; she said, flexing her fingers where his grip had left marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied her intently, regret shadowing his features. &#34;It&#39;s unnecessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can keep working. Just let me try this-l used to do this for my father when he was worn down from long days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of her father reminded him of the night when she got wasted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Arabella worked her fingers into his tense muscles, she noticed his increasingly stormy expression. Apparently, his standards were impossibly high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her eyes averted from his documents,concentrating solely on the massage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her delicate appearance, her touch carried surprising strength and precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher felt his rigid muscles gradually surrender under her skilled hands as they worked across his back and shoulders. Her technique was undeniably professional, and her subtle perfume clouded his senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He somehow felt turned on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gordon.&#34; Dominick entered carrying a stack of documents, then froze as if he had walked into an alternate reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arabella was actually touching Asher? The same man who recoiled from any female contact?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick&#39;s mind reeled as he tried to process the impossible scene before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly collected himself, set down the papers, and began, &#34;About tonight&#39;s event schedule-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move it to tomorrow. I&#39;m leaving in five minutes.&#34;Asher cut him off decisively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick felt his jaw nearly hit the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had happened to the workaholic who used to practically live at the office? The man who had once spent an entire month sleeping on his office couch during a major project?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he was rushing home-and the reason was standing right there. Dominick couldn&#39;t help stealing another glance at Arabella, finally understanding the seismic shift in his boss&#39;s priorities.</p>
