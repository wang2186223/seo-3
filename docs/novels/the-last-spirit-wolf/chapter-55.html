                <p>Chapter55</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;&#39;t know how long we&#39;&#39;ve been asleep for, but when I wake up, I feel so incredibly rested. I stretch my legs and arms and a dull ache reminds me of the what transpiredst night. My hand involuntarily goes to my neck where I now bear Noah&#39;&#39;s mark. It&#39;&#39;spletely healed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that Charlotte told me a while backes back to me; something about some abilities being shared between mates once they bear each other&#39;&#39;s mark. It could be that I have some of Noah&#39;&#39;s healing ability now. Feeling my movement, Noah stirs awake next to me and pulls me to him, kissing his mark on my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, my love,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile at the tenderness. His kiss on my neck also has another effect, though. If he keeps this up we&#39;&#39;ll be trapped in this cabin forever, just having sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning to you, too.&#34; I turn around to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He has a sleepy smile on his face and the golden sparks in his eyes seem to be dancing. He stretches out his limbs just as I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire went out at some point in the middle of the night, but I didn&#39;&#39;t even notice; Noah&#39;&#39;s body warmth was enough to keep usfortable the whole time we slept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something crosses Noah&#39;&#39;s eyes and the moment is gone. We both turn serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he... did he do anything to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Who?&#34; It takes me a moment to realize what he&#39;&#39;s asking, &#34;no, I ran before he could do anything. Nothing happened Noah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had a bruise on your arm when I got here, was that him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recount my experience with the King, and he did in fact grab me by the arm. I didn&#39;&#39;t realize it had left a bruise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably, yes. But again, nothing happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenches his jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;m going to kill him.&#34; His lycan stirs in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gets up, putting on his clothes.Content ? provided by N?velDrama.Org.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah.&#34; I get up as well, putting on my own clothes, &#34;what are you doing? What are you thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;&#39;t know how, I don&#39;&#39;t know when, but I *will* kill him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lycan is almostpletely awake now, judging by his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah... Noah, look at me,&#34; I take his face in my hands, &#34;we have to get out of here, we have to go back to the pack house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But first, we *kill him*,&#34; he says. I can sense this is his lycan speaking, his voice is deeper than Noah&#39;&#39;s. I roll my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, I need Noah back, please.&#34; I coax him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;&#39;s breathing heavy, rugged breathes, but heplies. He closes his eyes and when they open back up again, Noah&#39;&#39;s hazel eyes are back. He blinks at me in confusion. Was he really not in control just now? &#34;How often does that happen?&#34; I raise an eyebrow at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had to let him take full control back in the forest, he feels like he&#39;&#39;s the boss now. Sorry, I&#39;&#39;ll reel him in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened, exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both go to sit on the couch now that his lycan is back under.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We found footsteps in the forest, they looked exactly like the chimera from the pack house. We followed its trail but found nothing else. That&#39;&#39;s when they all turned on me, trying to kill me. If I hadn&#39;&#39;t let this beast takeplete control, I don&#39;&#39;t think I would be sitting here right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take his hand on mine. I can&#39;&#39;t imagine how painful it must be to have your own betray you like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The King is the one that wants you dead, Noah. It was all his doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but those guys really wanted me dead, too. They never hesitated. Good thing is, I didn&#39;&#39;t either.&#34; There&#39;&#39;s a pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eli told me he wanted me dead because he wanted you as his mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something grim passes his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You talked to Eli?! When?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He went looking for me into the forest. By the time he found me, I was already heading back to the castle to kill the King myself, but he told me everything that happened, he even told me where you were, that&#39;&#39;s how I found you.&#34; &#34;How are they? Have there been any punishments for helping me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;&#39;t be able to forgive myself if something happened to them because of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no. The King has kept all of this quiet; protecting his ego is more important. He has scouts looking for you, but I killed the best of them back in the woods. Lucas grabbed some of your clothes and directed them to wolf territory; they have no reason to believe you didn&#39;&#39;t go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stay quiet for a moment, both lost in our thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah, he didn&#39;&#39;t only want you dead because he wanted me as his mate. He wanted you dead because he knows how strong you are, he knows that you could easily take his throne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I don&#39;&#39;t want his stupid throne, I have never been interested in it and quite frankly, If I was, I would&#39;&#39;ve made a move by now with all his shitty management.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I know, and I think there&#39;&#39;s more to it but I haven&#39;&#39;t quite figured it out yet. Eli also thinks it has to do with your father, who apparently was one of the strongest fighters to ever live or something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raises his eyebrow at me, &#34;He told you that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys became close while I was gone, huh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I roll my eyes. Men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do now, though? He thinks I went back home, and he has no reason to believe you&#39;&#39; re alive. We have to get back to wolf territory. We&#39;&#39;ll be safe in the pack house, we can live a normal life there.&#34; He clenches his jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Running isn&#39;&#39;t in my nature, Vera.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what choice do we have?! You almost got killed, I almost got turned into that asshole&#39;&#39;s baby-maker, what&#39;&#39;s to say our fate wouldn&#39;&#39;t be worse if we returned?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I know. Hey,&#34; he puts his hand on my leg, &#34;we&#39;&#39;ll figure something out. I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, we can&#39;&#39;t stay here forever. And a n won&#39;&#39;t just fall onto ourps like magic!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just on cue, there&#39;&#39;s a knock on the door.</p>
