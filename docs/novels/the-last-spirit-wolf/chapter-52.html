                <p>Chapter52</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corridors, or rather tunnels, that Elden sent me on are endless. I&#39;&#39;m sure they cover the entirety of the castle, just like back at the Pack House. It&#39;&#39;s unsurprising considering how many wars were fought, and lost, back in the age of witches. Tunnels like these were the difference between the life or death of an entire n.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think maybe 30 minutes have passed since I entered these tunnels and there is no sign of them ending. I&#39;&#39;m beginning to think maybe Elden sent me through the wrong one, or purposefully deceived me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No...it can&#39;&#39;t be. He showed as much disdain for King Alistair before, there is no reason for him to help him now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless, he&#39;&#39;s using me as a bargaining chip to get something he wants, and right now he&#39;&#39;s using this time to negotiate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;&#39;s not normal for me to be paranoid, and right now all it&#39;&#39;s doing is messing with my head.N?velDrama.Org owns ? this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After walking some more, I smell something. It&#39;&#39;s the light scent of citrus that usually apanies Elden&#39;&#39;s teas. I follow that scent, picking up my pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I&#39;&#39;m at a wider portion of the tunnels, the scent of lemon intensifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach what appears to be a wall, keeping me from advancing further. I step closer, feeling the stone and realize it&#39;&#39;s the same material that I entered through; it&#39;&#39;s a fake wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carefully, I push and pull on it, mimicking the motion Elden had done earlier to open the painting that revealed the tunnels. After fumbling around a bit, I hear the &#39;&#39;click&#39;&#39; from before and carefully peek through; cold air hitting my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There seems to be no one around and I venture outside, carefully closing the door behind me. In this case, the door isn&#39;&#39;t a painting, but rather a portion of the castle&#39;&#39;s wall of stone that appears to have been hollowed out to make way for the tunnels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell of lemon and other herbs hits me. I turn around to look at where that&#39;&#39;sing from and realize it&#39;&#39;s a small greenhouse. Upon further inspection, this is certainly the back end of the castle. I can see the huge stone walls behind me, and no clear entrance. I step closer to the greenhouse. It has been carefully tended to. There is everything from lemon grass, to rosemary, to lemon trees and even a bee hive. It&#39;&#39;s a veryplete garden and I have no doubt this is Elden&#39;&#39;s doing. This is where he gets everything he needs for his teas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decide to make myself a small herbal emergency kit. It mighte in handy if I encounter any guards in the woods. If I get injured, I&#39;&#39;ll have to rely solely on myself to heal, and I won&#39;&#39;t have the benefits of modern medicine where I&#39;&#39;m going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I have everything I need. I take onest look around to make sure I&#39;&#39;m here alone. I&#39;&#39;m so far away from the main areas of the castle that I can&#39;&#39;t hear anything in the form ofmotion, or people for that matter. There is an eerie silence in this part of the castle. It&#39;&#39;s almost as if no one is looking for me, but I know better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a quilt that I find on one of the ends of the greenhouse. The air is starting to get colder as nightfall approaches. The sun is barely providing any light at this point. I have to get going. Putting the quilt over my head to disguise myself, I venture towards the forest, reaching the edge in about 20 minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up ahead, I can see the snow covered mountains looming in the horizon. I had already sensed that there was something off putting about this forest even from far way, but now that I am up close, the feeling is unmistakable. It&#39;&#39;s almost as if by looking at it, someone or something is looking back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn back to look at the castle. There is indeed no one looking for me out here, for now. They have no reason to believe I have escaped; they&#39;&#39;re probably looking for me within the castle walls. Judging by how enormous the castle is, it&#39;&#39;ll take them all night to decipher that I&#39;&#39;m not in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a step forward into the woods, I have a sudden vision. It stops me in my tracks, but I can&#39;&#39;t make anything of it; they are all hazy, unfocused images. I take a few steps further in, my vision blurry due to the images in my head, but as I walk deeper into the forest, the vision gets clearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;&#39;s King Alistair and a woman in this exact forest. But something is different. King Alistair looks... younger? He even looks more muscr, much more like a warrior, than he does now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a long beard and deep ck hair, he&#39;&#39;s smiling warmly at the woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk even further into the forest, chasing the vision. I focus on what they&#39;&#39;re saying, trying to read their lips, but it&#39;&#39;s impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman is lean, with hair reaching all the way down her back. She has long, w like nails, and is bare feet. They&#39;&#39;re talking very close to one another, almost as if I am witnessing something intimate between them. King Alistair puts a hand on her arm and gently kisses her forehead; then, the woman disappears within the woods and King Alistair makes his way back to the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, just as sudden, the vision is gone. My eyesight is back and I blink to adjust to theck of light. The sun has now fully set and there is a full moon up in the sky. Judging from the position of the moon, I would say a couple of hours passed between my entering the forest and now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look around, thankfully the moon provides enough light for me to see clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;m lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had kept walking through my vision, trying to get closer to the King and that woman, but all I managed to do is get lost. I have no notion of where I am, I don&#39;&#39;t even know where I am rtive to the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crouch down, I&#39;&#39;m hesitant to connect to this forest given the awful feeling it gives me, but I really have no other option now that I&#39;&#39;m lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving the unpleasant feeling much thought, I burry my hand deep into the soil. It feels rugged, dry, and unfertile. I concentrate on the trees, the wind, anything and everything I can gather. It takes me several minutes of this to finally get a sense of where I am; back home, the forest is so alive that it doesn&#39;&#39;t take me long, but here, everything just seems dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I envision the cabin and where I should go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I begin walking, wrapping the quilt tightly around me. I&#39;&#39;m getting closer to the snowy mountains, and the air carries the eminent chill of the snow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;&#39;s not worse than the chill I feel in my heart as my mind inevitably starts thinking of Noah</p>
