                <p>Chapter12</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I told you we should have prepared her! Now neither of us is there and she is a target, Eleanor! Do you know what will happen if that witch gets a* *hold of her?! She can&#39;&#39;t even summon her Wolf!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Shh! She&#39;&#39;s awake.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Vera? Oh Vera, honey are you okay? How do you feel? Can you hear me?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;&#39;t know where I am, I don&#39;&#39;t know what happened. All I feel is... light. Light as a feather, almost like I&#39;&#39;m floating. Is this an out of body* *experience? Am I dead? Why does this ce seem so familiar? The people talking to me... I can hear them clearly, but I can&#39;&#39;t see them. Are my* *eyes even open? I feel like they are, but there is a fogginess to my vision. But.... know this ce?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; I call out hesitantly.&#34;N?velDrama.Org owns ? this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Oh, Vera, sweetheart. Don&#39;&#39;t be afraid. We won&#39;&#39;t hurt you. I&#39;&#39;m your gr-* *Don&#39;&#39;t you dare, mother! We agreed this was for the best!* why do I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*YOU agreed this was for the best, and look at her now! Do you know what this kind of magic can do to her?! She can&#39;&#39;t even defend herself for* *moon&#39;&#39;s sake! Vera, Vera darling, listen to me very carefully, you&#39;&#39;re in great danger, your entire pack is in great danger. You have to fight this; you can* *fight this. I will guide you, take my hand.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As confusing as this is, I do as I&#39;&#39;m told. I reach out my hand, expecting for the voice to take it, but instead, I feel them all. I feel the pressure of multiple hands, all at once. How is this even possible? What is even more bizarre, I feel as if I know each and every one of them, like we are all connected somehow. I start feeling lighter and lighter, like I&#39;&#39;m about to disappear, when I hear her voice again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It is done, my child.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, unconsciousness wees me again, or so I thought. The next moments are gued with many dream-like visions, like I&#39;&#39;m the spectator of a y. Everything is in motion, despite my presence. The clothes look antique, the vehicles and the buildings betray the era we are in. But how is this possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victor!&#34; A voice calls behind me. I turn to the voice, reading myself to be discovered. But instead, the figure passes right through me and hugs a man in a ck tuxedo behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master Ackley,&#34; the manposes himself and nods his head politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nonsense! My close friends need not call me &#39;&#39;master.&#39;&#39; Are you headed to the Grand Ball? Come,e! You shall ride in my carriage with my wife and I.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are too kind, friend. I will dly ept your offer; it seems there is a storm brooding in the horizon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man and I raise our heads to the clear skies above, silently questioning the man&#39;&#39;s forecast. When I turn my head back down, I gasp. The man named Victor is looking directly at me, never breaking eye contact. Can he see me?! I wave, frantically, desperate for an exnation, but he shakes his head ever so slightly, and with a flick of his raised hand, the scene changes once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;m in a great hall, withvish golden decorations, grand mirrors, and the highest ceilings I have ever seen. The chandeliers are high up and golden. I see numerous paintings and statues, all so perfect and elegant, it makes me question if this is all a dream after all. Everything seems to sparkle, but something captures my attention. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a painting that resembles a ce I know all too well; Jade Waterfall. I get closer to it, admiring the enormous painting. Strangely enough, even if the waterfall is most beautiful when the full moon shines on it, this painting depicts a new moon. There is no light at alling from the sky, and yet the waterfall is shining for itself. How odd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always knew how to throw a party, Allen!&#34; I&#39;&#39;m startled by the loud voice, followed by loudughs; it&#39;&#39;sing from behind a closed door. I approach the door tentatively, cing one hand on it to see if it would budge and to my surprise, it does. When I enter the room, there is no one in here. It seems to be an office of some sort, with uncountable books, tworge fireces, and an unmistakable wooden desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is Sofia&#39;&#39;s desk. But...how?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room itself seems abandoned, everything is covered in dust and spider webs. I look behind me and the grand hall I was just in now seems deste. There are no paintings, no statues, and the golden décor from before is either destroyed or under a very thickyer of dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night has fallen quickly outside, and my eyes adjust to amodate for theck of light. I exit the office through another door to its side, and suddenly I&#39;&#39;m on a balcony overseeing what were oncevish gardens. What in the Goddess&#39;&#39;s name happened here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The destruction outside is evident, there was a war fought here a long, long time ago. I lean on the balcony railing, my senses finallying to me. My leading theory is that I&#39;&#39;m dead, of course, and all of this is my brain&#39;&#39;s way of making sense out of it in my final moments. Eli probably killed me for dressing his wounds; or for being his proteges mate, who knows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the thought of Noah, an overwhelming sadness takes over me. They say losing a mate is a fate even worse than death. Losing a mate is akin to losing a part of yourself; the pain never fades, and you never forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crumble to the floor, tears streaming down my face as I try to catch my breath. I start hyperventting and my head starts to spin. I want nothing more than to be with Noah right now. Only a few days ago I wasn&#39;&#39;t even sure I wanted him, and now I can&#39;&#39;t imagine moving on without him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I want him, I need him. I don&#39;&#39;t even know him well, but I know I love him. Even when I was with him, I never felt such need, such connection. Now, I feel it even though we aren&#39;&#39;t close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever happens, whatever this is. I will find my way back to him. Whatever it takes.</p>
