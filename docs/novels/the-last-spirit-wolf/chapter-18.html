                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok. Noah, Eli, Lucas, grab your things. We can ess the tunnels through Sofia&#39;&#39;s office. Come on, quick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no, no,&#34; Eli begins, &#34;if you can see that thing, we need to take it down. If we run now, it might just catch up to uster anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I contemte the possibility of actually killing this thing and being done with it. Even if I can see it, I can&#39;&#39;t coordinate an attack, I can&#39;&#39;t mind link anyone but Sofia in the entire pack. Eli continues, &#34;Doc, we need to kill it. We need to know for sure what it is that attacked us and killed our men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I regard him for a few seconds; the old man is right. If we don&#39;&#39;t get rid of it now, what guarantee would we have that it won&#39;&#39;t just attack again? Clearly, the wolves and the Pack House are no longer off limits to it. Regardless, I have somewhere I have to be right now. Thinking about Sofia made me more attuned to her and her mind, I can feel her distress and her fear. I need to get to her, quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;&#39;ll talk about it on the way, take your packs just in case. Noah, don&#39;&#39;t give me that look.&#34; Noah was staring at me like a sad puppy but I couldn&#39;&#39;t focus on him right now. Whatever happens, whether they leave or stay and fight, leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. They all gathered their things and in no time we were rushing towards Sofia&#39;&#39;s office. The chaos as all the elderly, non-warrior women and children essed the tunnels was heart wrenching. Most of them didn&#39;&#39;t even know what was happening or how much danger they were actually in. This evacuation n has been in ce for decades, but it had only been used about a hundred years ago in times of war or an attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We entered the office without a problem as the upper floors had already been cleared. Alex came running to join us from the top stairs, meeting us at the door to the Alpha&#39;&#39;s office. He nodded at us solemnly, an empty expression in his gaze. He is linked to all the wolves in this pack through his bond with Sofia, but specially the warriors that are guarding the borders; after all he is a warrior himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reaches over to retrieve something from her bag,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;&#39;s a finely decorated spear, with tiny jewels along its base, and a long and lean shaft. I can tell this isn&#39;&#39;t a material I recognize. The de and its wings are long and elegant, with a decorated blue crystal hanging from its shaft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This, and you, are our only hope.&#34; Sofia breaks me out of my trance, and I know what I have to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I steady myself and focus. My heart rate slows as I tap into a part of myself I hadn&#39;&#39;t had use for in a very long time, not since I became a doctor. That primal, animalistic feeling I had trained many years to control. Even in human form, I knew this was what turning into a wolf would feel like.Material ? N?velDrama.Org.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my eyes, and my vision is razor sharp. I take the spear from Sofia, and I&#39;&#39;m ready to go after my prey.</p>
