                <p>We started running in the other direction and I gave them a look. We were going into wolf territory and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>we didn’t even care. We were more afraid of the thing after us than an entire pack of wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we were about to cross into wolf territory, the thing grabbed me by my torso, and started to crush</p>
                
                
                
                <p>me. The pain was unbearable and every time I tried to take a breath, the thing would hold me tighter,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>suffocating me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly started to lose consciousness, giving myself to the darkness, knowing this was the end but</p>
                
                
                
                <p>relieved I had entertained the beast enough for Eli and Noah to escape. I fell to the ground with a loud</p>
                
                
                
                <p>thud and to my dismay, someone picked me up; they hade back for me, they hadn’t escaped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eli picked me up and started running, if you can even call it that, but the thing had Noah by his mid</p>
                
                
                
                <p>body, crushing him slowly. I heard bones crack, and faint whimpering. Noah was being killed. I freed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>myself from Eli’s grasp, ready tounch myself at it but Eli stopped me, signaling for me to run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn’t. I was frozen. Not out of fear for the thing, but out of fear of losing someone I considered my</p>
                
                
                
                <p>older brother. Nheless, Eli outranked me and I couldn’t defy his order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a pain that was more than physical gripping my heart, we started running. Not a minute after we</p>
                
                
                
                <p>started running, we heard somethinging from our left side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack of wolves came running at full speed and howling and fangs bared. Eli took a defensive stand</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but I instead started running towards Noah. If the thing also attacked the wolves, it would leave Noah</p>
                
                
                
                <p>long enough for us to get to him. It was a cruel n, but this thing was already on wolf territory and was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>likely to attack them anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves followed me to the clearing where Noah was lying on the ground, immobile. I feared for the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>worst. As I approached, I realized Eli was behind me and we both picked our friend up. He was still</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hanging on, barely breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we turned around to run, we realized the wolves were fighting with the thing, apparently it had</p>
                
                
                
                <p>attacked them too, just as I predicted. Eli went to attack it too; if we had any chance to discovering what</p>
                
                
                
                <p>this thing was, we had to kill it, and right now, we could only do it with the wolves’ help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few moments, it was clear even the wolves were helpless against the invisible demon. Many of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>them were hurt, one of them I believed was dead, so their leader gave them a signal to retreat and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>gestured at us to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a panic, we didn’t think twice. We started running once again, deeper into wolf territory. I kept</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ncing back, as if I would be able to see the creature following us. It was silly, but it was instinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we reached the clearing, I noticed there were many wolves already there, snarling and growling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>loudly. They let us pass through and tightly closed their lines, clearly expecting an attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We headed towards a modern looking building, much different from our castles, and entered. I noticed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the people there were already tending to the wolf I thought was dead; I was in such a panic I didn’t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>even realize they had separated from us and arrived first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wide-eyed doctor saw use in and immediately sprinted to action, guiding Eli and I to a bed to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ce Noah in. Eli and I copsed. I was about to pass out but noticed Noah was awake and looking at</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the doctor, he was whispering something and she got closer to hear him; I heard him the first time. I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>listened more intently the second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mate,” he says. I’m wide eyed as I regard the doctor. Is she really Noah’s mate? He t lines and I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fight my body, willing it to stand. I’m right next to him as the doctor shocks him once, twice, three times</p>
                
                
                
                <p>until he’s back. They wheel him out to an OR, and I pass out cold on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Noah…” is all I can manage when I finallye to. I’m on a hospital bed, fully bandaged with an I.V</p>
