                <p>Chapter30</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Noah-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;&#39;t have any intentions of having Vera see this first hand, but I did tell her that most lycans I knew were pieces of shit, none so more than Randall. When I saw him approaching and his eyes shifted. I knew exactly where this was going, and I knew exactly how it had to end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving and going into wolf territory, we knew that when we came back, we would get a lot of shit from everyone. Lycans are very opportunistic and they would being for us just to prove a point. And now with Vera here, as my mate, they would target me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Killing Randall in front of all his friends was a clear message to every lycan here; mess with my mate, and I&#39;&#39;ll have your head. No doubt the message was understood.Material ? N?velDrama.Org.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was done getting dressed, I looked over to Randall, dead on the ground, and scoffed. Quite frankly, killing him didn&#39;&#39;t even faze me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked over to where Vera was still looking at Randall and put my hand on her cheek, focusing her attention on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;m sorry you had to see that, but there was no other way. We are being used of being deserters. Lycans are opportunistic and they will try to earn some credit by making examples of us...&#34; I pause because I don&#39;&#39;t know how Vera will take this, &#34;that also includes you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand,&#34; she says tly, smiling softly at me, a smile that doesn&#39;&#39;t reach her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We resume walking. Vera lost in thought. I wish I could know what she was thinking about. Is she thinking maybe this is a mistake? Coming with me? When we were at the pack house, I thought about staying there with her several times. We never got to talk about it, but she simply agreed toe with me. I was too happy to question her as to why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality, had we stayed at the Pack House, there was no guarantee that whatever force created the chimera, wouldn&#39;&#39;te back for me eventually. I would never be able to ce her pack under such risk again. Too many had already died because of Eli, Lucas and myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We continued walking, Lucas first, Vera second, and Eli and I hanging back several steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You worry too much about her.&#34; Eli interrupts my sulking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you me me? I&#39;&#39;m bringing her to live into a den of snakes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eli, better than anyone, knows how cut throat our home is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;&#39;s proven to be very capable, son. If it came to it, I&#39;&#39;m sure she would be able to defend herself against the very best of us. She&#39;&#39;s a woman fit to be your mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grimace at this. That&#39;&#39;s exactly why I worry. I&#39;&#39;m one of the strongest, if not the strongest warrior here. That puts a target on her back, if only to weaken me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;m thinking of taking her to the country side once all this desertion business is taken care of, I don&#39;&#39;t want her here, Eli.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you underestimate your role here, Noah. the King and the Council would rather see you dead than let you go. Think about your decisions carefully, now they won&#39;&#39;t only affect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eli steps ahead of me, leaving me alone to think. He&#39;&#39;s right. The King will never let me go. Sometimes I feel like that jackass has it against me, but I cannot disobey the King&#39;&#39;s orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few more hours of walking like this, we reach the castle. It&#39;&#39;s early in the afternoon and there is still plenty of light to see people&#39;&#39;s faces as they smell Vera. It makes my blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;&#39;s keeping her head up. We had already talked about how her arrival here might be perceived. What I didn&#39;&#39;t tell her is that it was so because she wasn&#39;&#39;t marked by me yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear to me that something was holding her back. I&#39;&#39;m not one to judge or question her choices, she&#39;&#39;ll be ready when she&#39;&#39;s ready. It also crossed my mind that she was holding back because once we marked each other, she could no longer reject me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As it stands, since she doesn&#39;&#39;t have my mark, she can still choose to reject me and go back home if everything here bes too overwhelming.    I couldn&#39;&#39;t me her; she was looking out for herself and she was being smart about it. But I also couldn&#39;&#39;t help but imagine myself going deep inside her and putting my mark on her neck. Just thinking about it made me horny at a time when I most definitely shouldn&#39;&#39;t be. We were about to face trial for being deserters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just hope that Eli&#39;&#39;s n to prove our innocence works, otherwise I won&#39;&#39;t get to show Vera exactly what she&#39;&#39;s missing.</p>
