                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ckwood. Victor ckwood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men shake hands, but that is thest thing I see because I am once again transported to another vision. But this time, I recognize it as my time as I see wolves I recognize from the pack. We seem to be at the northern border with heavy wolf patrol. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a huge figure of what can only be described as a beast, or rather abination of beasts. This is what would be called a chimera in ancient times. Its size alone is intimidating, and its maws simting that of a giant lion make it evident that this is a killing machine. I see it approaching our lines, but the wolves seem oblivious. Can they not see this monstrosity?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beast picks up its pace, and rams head first into our wolves. Their cries of pain have me screaming at the top of my lungs,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch out! He&#39;&#39;s right in front of you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation grips at my soul when I realize none of them can hear me. This must be the same beast that attacked Noah and his friends. I am of no use here; I start running towards the pack house as fast as my legs allow. If I can find my body, maybe I can warn them, maybe I can save them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach the packhouse faster than I anticipated, maybe I am faster in this state. I climb up the stairs to the clinic and try to settle down and think, where could my body be? Thest thing I remember is being with Eli, I head there first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see Eli and Lucas talking passively, each in their own bed. Noah isn&#39;&#39;t here, and my body isn&#39;&#39;t here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Think, Vera, where else could they have taken me. I go to the nurse&#39;&#39;s station hoping to locate my chart, I reach it but my chart is nowhere to be found. Panic, once again, finds me; we don&#39;&#39;t keep charts on dead people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I keep looking, heading to the second floor where I can also check the morgue records and find out if I&#39;&#39;m actually dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I pass the MRI machine, something stops me in my tracks. I sniff the air. No doubt this is Noah&#39;&#39;s scent. I follow it, knowing that If I am alive, he has not left my side however long I&#39;&#39;ve been gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I enter the room, and sure enough, my body is there hooked to all the machines I know. Noah is sleeping beside me on his side, an arm protectively wrapped around me. I take a quick look at the machine; everything seems to be in order with my body. I&#39;&#39;m in good health despite being asleep.   Seeing Noah here with me warms my heart, it feels right, it feels like home. But I don&#39;&#39;t have time to ponder on how amazing the mate bond feels because I have to warn them. I reach out to my hand, and just like before, I begin to feel lighter than a feather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When my eyes open again, I don&#39;&#39;t feel light, I feel incredibly weak. I must have been out for weeks. I sit up on my bed with abruptly and start unhooking myself from the machines, even tearing out the IV I had in my arm. Blood is soon dripping down my arm. The beast ising. Noah jolts awake beside me too,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah, it&#39;&#39;sing, it&#39;&#39;sing for you. You have to get out! You have to leave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa, Vera, calm down, what are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw it, Noah! It breached our borders, it&#39;&#39;s a matter of minutes before it reaches the pack house! You have to warn your friends and leave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, first of all, I&#39;&#39;m not going anywhere without you,&#34; he reaches for my arm and assesses the blooding out of it, &#34;second of all, you probably just had a bad dream.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For Goddess&#39;&#39;s sake! Listen to me! That thing that nearly killed you and the others, it&#39;&#39;sing here, right now! You HAVE to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;m still very weak but I muster enough energy to get off the bed and head into the bathroom to quickly change into the scrubs I was wearing earlier when I passed out. Or died. I don&#39;&#39;t even know yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I head out and Noah is still calmly sitting on the bed. As much as he&#39;&#39;s my mate, he&#39;&#39;s aplete idiot for not listening to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I cannot wait for you, I have to alert the others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;m out the door and down the stairs. The lethargy in my muscles is slowing me down but they are quickly regaining their strength. I get to the nurses&#39;&#39; station and no one is here, I head into the lycan&#39;&#39;s room and find Sam and Violet re dressing the wounds of both lycans, much to my surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;&#39;s here, you both have to leave. NOW.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All parties are looking at me with puzzled expressions but also relief. Violet is about to step towards me when the pack house rm goes off, panic immediately visible in both Sam&#39;&#39;s and Violet&#39;&#39;s eyes. They both know what that means.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evac, now. We have protocol for this. Remain calm and help our patients into the tunnels.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Themotion can already be heard outside and Sam and Violet immediately sprint into action. Everyone has a role to y in this n and none can miss a beat.Contentt bel0ngs to N0ve/lDra/ma.O(r)g!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lycans begin to hurriedly dress in clothes Sofia had provided them with, along with packs of rations that had been previously prepared for them. Noah walks in to all themotion, &#34;How did you know?&#34; He asks me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw it. That thing is going to kill all of us to get to you three, you have to leave, now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, what do you mean you saw it?&#34; Lucas starts towards me and I understand now, none of them could see the creature, but I could. They will most likely want answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vera, Sofia needs you, she says you know where,&#34; Violet quickly pokes her head through the door and just like she appeared, she dives back into the chaos outside. Moon Goddess, if that means what I think it means... it can&#39;&#39;t be. She can&#39;&#39;t possibly be inbor right now, right?!</p>
