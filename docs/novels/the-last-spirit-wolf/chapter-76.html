                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After walking aimlessly through the castle for what feels like hours, I settle for going to the gym and train some more before dinner time. I&#39;&#39;m still so angry at Noah for thinking so selfishly, and specially for thinking of leaving me here... again. I run for an hour, I train with Eli&#39;&#39;s students for another hour, and then even lift weights, which I hate; all of this in hopes of releasing my frustration, but it&#39;&#39;s no use. I still don&#39;&#39;t know what Noah will decide, in the end it&#39;&#39;s his decision and he will do what he thinks is best; even if it&#39;&#39;s this stupid n. I&#39;&#39;m in no ce to tell him what to do, but at least I hope I made him reconsider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I&#39;&#39;m done training, I can barely lift my legs up the stairs to go to our room, but I&#39;&#39;m in desperate need for a shower. My frustration isn&#39;&#39;t only about Noah&#39;&#39;s n, but part of me misses being busy all the time, as weird as it sounds. Back at the Pack House, I had a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>purpose. Here, I have yet to find my ce. I know things will get better once Noah is settled in the throne; I&#39;&#39;ve even thought about opening up a clinic here, but it might take longer than I&#39;&#39;d like it to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once in the shower, I take my time under the warm water and try to meditate; clear my mind. I still have to tell Eli and Noah about my n to find Alistair, I&#39;&#39;m just not in the mood to argue with either one of them right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh, turning off the shower and grabbing a towel. My hair is dripping water down my back and shoulders. Staring at myself in the mirror, I realize I&#39;&#39;m not even hungry anymore; I&#39;&#39;m just really, really tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrap a towel on my head, put on a t-shirt, and plop myself on the bed, arms stretched. Without realizing it, I&#39;&#39;m slowly falling asleep, my eyelids heavy. In a few minutes, I&#39;&#39;m too tired to keep my eyes open and I fall asleep, thinking of Noah and wondering if he will go through with his n.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My dear,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;&#39;s Margaret&#39;&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my eyes and I&#39;&#39;m in their realm. I blink several times adjusting to the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Uhm, hi,* I say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It&#39;&#39;s good to see you again so soon! We thought it would take a few months.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Why would it take months?* I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Because it takes a lot of magical energy to be here, Vera. Some witches only traveled once a year, * Eleanor says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Vera,* Margaret turns to me, *It&#39;&#39;s important we begin your training. I&#39;&#39;m afraid there&#39;&#39;s already chatter about an unknown magical being in your world. Of course, they don&#39;&#39;t* *know it&#39;&#39;s you, and they don&#39;&#39;t know what you are, but it&#39;&#39;s only a matter of time.* *Actually, I was hoping you could help me with something. There&#39;&#39;s a man in my world that has gone insane, he took some moon peonie tea and it helped but, is there any* *way to cure him with... magic?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both my grandmother and aunt stare at each other and then at me,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Well, you see,* auntie Eleonor says, *witches each have a gift they excel at. It could be healing, it could be spells, it could be premonition or visions, like yourself. But no* *witch has all of them. Presumably, your gift is visions like your father, we won&#39;&#39;t know if you can also heal until we start your training.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; my grandmother interjects, &#34;did you say, moon peonies?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They share a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Tell us exactly what you did with those flowers, Vera.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I proceed to tell them everything about the flowers, what I felt when I touched them, how they multiplied and bloomed; even how I tried to replicate that feeling with Beta Caleb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Fascinating,* my grandmother says, deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Do you think she could... do you think she could have more than one gift? Because to do that without training... it took me years to revive a simple nt.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Let&#39;&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves, moon peonies are magic conductors. We will find out what other gifts you have as you train, Vera. For now, I want to focus on your gift* *of vision.  It was incredibly useful to your father, and I imagine it will be to you, too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Normally I don&#39;&#39;t have problems getting visions. It was easier back home in the forest, I&#39;&#39;d just concentrate on my surroundings; the trees, roots, flowers, animals,* *everything and it would just... show me...if that makes sense. But I&#39;&#39;ve also done it here.* Now they&#39;&#39;ve turned quiet and are looking at me as if I have a bug on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What?&#34; I ask annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It&#39;&#39;s... It&#39;&#39;s just unexpected... could it be we didn&#39;&#39;t seal her magic properly?* my aunt asks my grandmother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*No, no, we did.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*But then she also visited me spontaneously in dreams, like when she was child, even after we locked her magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I know, I know. I will have to consult with our elders while you teach Vera her breathing exercises. Vera, dear, I&#39;&#39;m sorry to leave you but I have to... consult... something.&#34; My grandmother smiles apologetically and just like that, she&#39;&#39;s gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn to my aunt, my eyebrow raised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Darling, what you are describing is a very rare gift. Only the original witches were able to connect to the forest in the way you describe. Add to that the fact that you did it* *even when your magic was blocked, and without a spell? It&#39;&#39;s not rare... it&#39;&#39;s unheard of.* &#34;In the book I was reading, it says that witches are naturally connected to nature... I thought that&#39;&#39;s what it was.*Content ? provided by N?velDrama.Org.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yes, it&#39;&#39;s true, and before our species became corrupted, it was a gift that flowed naturally in all of us. Now, it&#39;&#39;s only possible to get visions from the forest through* *conductors or spells. You see, the forest is a living being, it can choose who to show the visions to. Conductors and spells are a way to force it to show us things.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pauses for a moment,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Anyway, let&#39;&#39;s get into your breathing and concentration exercises,* She says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I follow her instructions step by step, feeling myself rx as time passes. Then, I feel a spark at the center of my chest and gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Good girl, hold on to that feeling, breathe in deeply and let it expand through your entire body as you exhale.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I do as I&#39;&#39;m told and I can feel the warm electricity expanding from my chest to the rest of my body; somehow, even my hair feels electric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Excellent. Now open your eyes and try to hold on to it.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I open my eyes, much to my disappointment, the feeling is almostpletely gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What happened? I felt it everywhere and now it&#39;&#39;s gone?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Patience, my darling. Mastering the fluctuations of magic within us takes practice,* she pauses and looks to her right and smiles, *for now, I think you better return to your* *world, someone&#39;&#39;s waiting for you.* When I blink again, I&#39;&#39;m no longer in their realm; I&#39;&#39;m in my world, lying in bed, with a heavy arm draped across my belly.</p>
