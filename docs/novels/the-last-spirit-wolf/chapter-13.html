                <p>Chapter13</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Noah-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT DID YOU DO?!&#34; My vision is turning blurry, a clear indication that my lycan is ready to pounce. I have never felt such rage, such murderous intent towards anyone in my life, but as I hold Eli in the air by his neck, that is all I can think about. &#34;Noah, he already told you it wasn&#39;&#39;t him! Come on, let him go!&#34; Lucas is right next to me but his presence is onlyparable to a pesky mosquito.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do to her, Eli? Tell me, I promise I won&#39;&#39;t bite.&#34; My lycan teeth are starting toe in slowly in a sarcastic smile; if this man doesn&#39;&#39;t answer my question, I&#39;&#39;ll end him. My lycan agrees with me as he&#39;&#39;s all too happy to kill someone for his mate. Doctorse rushing in and I recognize Violet, the nurse, and Dr. Owens. They rush to Vera who is still copsed on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried waking her before, but nothing worked. So here we are now, with me about to kill my mentor and Vera still on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boy! Help us move her upstairs to the MRI machine, it&#39;&#39;ll be quicker!&#34; I recognize this as Dr. Owens&#39;&#39;s voice, but what he&#39;&#39;s saying doesn&#39;&#39;t register until hees over and gives me a hard whack to the ribs. &#34;I&#39;&#39;m talking to you, you beast! Help us or I&#39;&#39;ll break your other ribs!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ie to my senses and look over to Vera. Violet was trying to hold her up but now is immobile, her eyes wide as she stares at me; I can smell her fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let go of Eli and he falls with a loud thud, Lucas quickly stepping in to help him up. I gather Vera in my arms and follow Dr. Owens to a flight of stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is quicker, go! I&#39;&#39;ll meet you there! Look for Dr. Alcott.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rush up the stairs, ignoring that my entire body is in pain. I&#39;&#39;ve healed a lot since waking up. but I&#39;&#39;m still not fully recovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach the door leading to the floor Dr. Owens indicated and am greeted by who I assume is Dr. Alcott. He rushes to us and ces his hand on Vera&#39;&#39;s cheek, brushing the hair off her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Goddess, Vera. Please, follow me.&#34; I hesitantly agree. Why did their touch seem so intimate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We reach a door leading to an MRI machine. I ce Vera as Dr. Alcott starts it up. He&#39;&#39;s staring at her longer than I find appropriate and instinctively growl. I hold his gaze until he bes ufortable; he clears his throat and instructs me to follow him to the other side of the ss, where theputers are.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after, Dr. Owens enters the room with a chart and they begin the test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few minutes, the only thing that is clear is that neither doctor knows what the hell is going on with my mate. They have called in multiple doctors to take a look at the scans, and only one offered the simple suggestion of &#39;&#39;the machine is probably malfunctioning!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about thirty minutes, Sofia Allen, whom I was in a meeting with just before feeling that something was wrong with Vera, joins us in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut it down, doc. This isn&#39;&#39;t something any of you can fix. Put her in a room, make herfortable, check her vitals.&#34; They both stare at her with a puzzled look, but can&#39;&#39;t deny her request. She is their alpha after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once in the room, Vera is hooked up to many machines I have grown ustomed to. The faint beep of her heartbeat is the only sound I can focus on even when there are seven other people in the room between nurses and doctors. They&#39;&#39;re all taking notes in various charts and taking blood from her to run tests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite everything happening right now, my heart swells with pride knowing how well loved and respected Vera is in her pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sofia once again joins us, now apanied by her husband. All doctors and nurses raise their heads and turn to Sofia. She speaks,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone out, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone leaves, except Dr. Owens and Dr. Alcott.N?velDrama.Org owns ? this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gives Dr. Alcott an annoyed look,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You too, William.&#34; He hesitates but bows his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moves to leave but before he closes the door, he looks back longingly at Vera. This shit is too much. I ce myself in his line of sight and quietly snarl. Only he can see me and the threat is implicit. He quickly leaves the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sofiaes closer to Vera and as she sits at the foot of the bed. She ces a hand on my arm, drawing my attention to her instead of the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;&#39;t mind him. He and Vera used to date. It&#39;&#39;s nothing to worry about, he found his mate and have a lovely family together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He and my mate used to WHAT? I give Sofia a long look, beckoning her to tell me more. She rolls her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lycan, werewolf, men are all the same. Dr. Owens, would you please,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Owens clears his throat, reminding me there are more pressing issues at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is nothing obviously wrong with Vera. Her vitals are stable, the MRIs showed nothing more than our need to rece the machine. She&#39;&#39;s essentially...asleep.&#34; We stare at him, expecting there to be more. &#34;Sorry, that&#39;&#39;s all I got for you. Whatever is happening to her isn&#39;&#39;t of biological or medical nature.&#34; Sofia looks over to Vera, then to each and every one of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I&#39;&#39;m about to tell you can&#39;&#39;t leave this room.&#34; She pauses for a moment, as if hesitating. She isn&#39;&#39;t sick, and she hasn&#39;&#39;t been poisoned. She&#39;&#39;s been cursed.&#34;</p>
