                <p>I take onest look at the cabin, making sure everything is just as when I found it. Afterall, this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>is Elden&#39;&#39;s home; I imagine he&#39;&#39;s very excited to get it back for himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Locking everything up. Noah turns to me and offers his hand,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As ready as I&#39;&#39;ll ever be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;&#39;s going to be alright. V. You&#39;&#39;ll be great.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, you keep saying that and it doesn&#39;&#39;t really help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;&#39;s just performance jitters, you&#39;&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take his hand and we head out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun hasn&#39;&#39;t risen so we walk with thest hours of light the moon has to offer. It&#39;&#39;s a very pleasant walk, unlike the first time I came to the cabin. The forest still has quite an unweing feeling to it, but having Noah by my side makes everything better; it calms</p>
                
                
                
                <p>me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walk for a few hours, taking in all of our surroundings as a way to distract ourselves from the task castle, not before giving me a long, tender kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I enter the tunnels, guided again by the scent of Elden&#39;&#39;s garden, and begin my walk towards the librar</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To bepletely honest, this n seems ridiculous. There are so many things that have been left at that either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long walk, I make it to the library and am greeted by Elden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wee back, Vera.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;&#39;s smiling at me, but it does very little to reassure me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here,&#34; he says, handing me my spear which he had retrieved from Noah&#39;&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head in disbelief,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One of these days you&#39;&#39;ll have to tell me how you get around without being noticed, Elden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>d. When we reach the clearing. Noah and I part ways. I go to the underground tunnels, the same tunnels by which I escaped, and he heads to the front of the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>; anything could happen. It&#39;&#39;s stressing me out knowing that if one thing doesn&#39;&#39;t go as nned, we will have to improvise, and we don&#39;&#39;t have much room for</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From what Eli told us, Noah&#39;&#39;s room and all the ces that I frequented within the castle were still in constant watch by the guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well then, today is your lucky day! Nobody can know you&#39;&#39;re here until it&#39;&#39;s time. Come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walk to another part of the library, another entrance to the tunnels guarded by a massive painting. This time, it&#39;&#39;s of a man with a strong build and regal posture. There&#39;&#39;s something oddly familiar about this man but I can&#39;&#39;t quite ce him. &#34;Who are these people, Elden, the ones in the paintings? This man seems familiar and the other woman... who were they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hush, child. We must hurry. Your mate must be about to make it to the front of the castle. If anything happens, you have to be ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ushers me into the tunnels, following closely behind after closing the concealed door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Follow me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I do as I&#39;&#39;m told and we walk in silence. These tunnels are smaller than the ones that led me outsidest time; there isn&#39;&#39;t enough space for me to walk besides Elden so I walk a few steps behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about twenty minutes and too many turns to remember, we arrive at a part of the castle I don&#39;&#39;t recognize, but it has a direct line of sight to the entrance of the castle through some peepholes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stand there in silence, waiting for Noah. After only a couple of minutes, we hearmotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;&#39;s back! Tell the King he&#39;&#39;s back!&#34; We hear a voice, followed by heavy footsteps hurrying to open the massive doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart starts speeding. This is it. This is the moment where we&#39;&#39;ll know if our n has a shot of working or this is where it all ends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Warrior Noah!&#34; screams one of the guards; a small crowd has begun to form around the entrance but Noah isn&#39;&#39;t being let in just yet, &#34;where are the rest of your scoutingpanions?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I killed them.&#34; Noah says tly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs erupt all throughout the crowd. Some are outraged, but most are simply shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why would you do that?!&#34; An angry guard steps forward, challenging Noah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;&#39;s none of your business, but if you&#39;&#39;d like to find out *how* I did it, you&#39;&#39;re wee toe closer.&#34; Noah grins at him, his lycan teeth showing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd once again begins murmuring and whispering amongst themselves. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Eli and Lucas; Eli is looking our way, knowingly. He can&#39;&#39;t see us as we are still within the tunnels and therefore within the castle walls, but he knows the n; he knows we&#39;&#39;re here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, we hear what we were waiting for; heavy footstepsing from the winding staircases that lead directly to the King&#39;&#39;s quarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;&#39;s here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well, well,&#34; King Alistair says as he descends out of our sight, &#34;what do we have here? The *traitor* Noah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clench my fist. Just listening to his nasty voice naming Noah makes my blood boil. I grip my spear with both hands now, Elden inching closer to the concealed door that would expose us to everyone. He nods at me, and I nod at him. I look over to Eli; he and Lucas have begun to move to the strategic points they had nned out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is the moment of truth. What will the King do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few minutes of silence, the Kinges into vision, standing in front of the entrance to the castle with that ridiculous robe of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guards, take the *traitor to the dungeons. We will have his trial first thing in the morning. gather the Council,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh in relief, softening the grip on the spear as Elden retrieves from the door. This is the best case scenario for now; we were afraid the King would have him executed right here, right now, but Eli was right, he&#39;&#39;d want to make a spectacle out of it and for that, he needs time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fare the trial</p>
