                <p>My rounds at the clinic started at 7:00 a.m. but the idea of staring at the ceiling of my room any longerN?velDrama.Org owns ? this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took my time in the hot bath to clear my thoughts about everything going on. My heart felt like it wa I entered the clinic a full hour before I had to be there and started prepping for the day. I head to the I gracefully ept and make small talk until it is a decent time to go find my patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I make my way to his room, it&#39;&#39;s odd, but for some reason, I can&#39;&#39;t *feel* him. This fact unsettles me As I push the room door open, the only one there is Eli, and he is already looking my way before my e &#34;He&#39;&#39;s not here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Noah&#39;&#39;s neatly done bed; clearly he&#39;&#39;s been gone for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving closer to the old man, I gauge his reaction with every step. This time, I don&#39;&#39;t perceive any host &#34;I can see that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a few supplies from the tray by one of the beds and approach him. He watches me silently. On r incorrectly dressed wounds and assume he did this to himself; I refuse to believe any one of our staff I reach for the scissors and he growls, threatening me, but I don&#39;&#39;t give a damn. I take his arm and star I take a look at all the half-healed wounds all over his arms. The other two lycans have been healing s &#34;You heal slower.&#34; I say. It isn&#39;&#39;t a question, it&#39;&#39;s a statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;m old,&#34; he states tly, his eyes not meeting mine, rather staying focus on my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get to work on all his wounds, cleaning them and dressing them correctly. When I get to the arm on t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I probe around with my hands and its clear this arm had been dislocated, had he tried fixing this on h Owens about fixing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>iving me anxiety. I tossed the sheets and got in the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>thump out of my chest at the idea of looking into those hazel eyes again, but I could not ignore how heavy it also felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ria and find Sam who offers me a warm cup of tea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to walk a little faster; I didnt think he had any procedure scheduled for today, and he sure as hell shouldn&#39;&#39;t be walking around in his condition. d on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>om him at all. How odd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>er hand, I take one of the visitor&#39;&#39;s chair and ce it to sit at his side, facing him.   I asses all of his ers could so such a poor job, albeit intentionally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>iding all his dressings, careful not to pick his skin. I can feel him tense, but he doesn&#39;&#39;t stop me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>y; this one should be further along in his healing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>g, he flinches ever so slightly as I remove his makeshift sling; the gesture doesn&#39;&#39;t escape me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>? It was incorrectly done and probably incredibly painful. His fracture had not been addressed and it had been healing incorrectly. I&#39;&#39;d have to talk to Dr.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to pop this in correctly, would you like something to bite down on?&#34; He clenches his jaw, I&#39;&#39;ll ta.......t as a no. I also assume he doesn&#39;&#39;t want any pain killers either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I extend his arm, cing one hand on his shoulder, minding his fracture, feeling my way through the process. I begin shaking his extended arm very slowly and lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a couple of seconds of this, I feel the tell-tell &#39;&#39;ck&#39;&#39; of his shoulder under my fingers and snap it into ce. This is normally an extremely painful process, but Eli didn&#39;&#39;t even flinch this time. He&#39;&#39;s probably too proud to show any weakness to a wolf like myself; I sigh and shake my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep it on the sling for a couple more days, it should heal properly now. I&#39;&#39;ll have to talk to Dr. Owens about fixing your fracture, it&#39;&#39;s been healing incorrectly.&#34; He nods and I turn my attention to his face, there is one wound that appears to need some cleaning. &#34;Don&#39;&#39;t even think about it,&#34; He&#39;&#39;s giving me an icy look, looking straight into my eyes. I sit back down on the chair and recline back, crossing my arms and legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks like shit, though.&#34; I tell him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snorts, I don&#39;&#39;t know if out of amusement or annoyance. We stay like that for a while, me scowling at the wounds he won&#39;&#39;t let me touch, and him scowling at my general self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you really are his mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I&#39;&#39;ve been told.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you don&#39;&#39;t feel it?&#34; His question sounds so hopeful, it&#39;&#39;s a littleical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no, I feel it, he&#39;&#39;s definitely my mate.&#34; His hope ttens as he pinches the bridge of his nose with his fingers, his eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stay silent for a while. Whatever he&#39;&#39;s thinking about, he&#39;&#39;s not sharing with me; he&#39;&#39;s merely staring out the window at the forest with a pensive look. I get up to get some water and as I&#39;&#39;m holding up the pitcher, I feel a painful pinch at the back of the neck. I turn, my hand instinctively going to the base of my neck. I assume Eli has done something to me, but he&#39;&#39;s still sitting in his chair looking out the window, not even paying attention to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the I-&#34; and then, I see red. I drop the pitcher, ss scattering everywhere although I barely notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My skin feels like it&#39;&#39;s on fire and its spreading too all of my nerve endings. I don&#39;&#39;t even have time to cry out; my vision getting blurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drop to the floor with a thump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thest thing I remember is Eliing to me and calling for help.</p>
