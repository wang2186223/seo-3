                <p>Chapter60</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes forcefully, not wanting to be witness to such cruelty anymore. When I open them back up. I&#39;&#39;m out of those horrid dungeons; my grandmother and aunt looming over me in concern. One of them ces her hand on my head, consoling me. *I&#39;&#39;m sorry, darling, but we had to show you what our species hade to. Your father understood well that we could no longer exist under these pretenses. The Witch* *Mother is pure evil.* *Is?* I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My aunt turns to me grimly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yes, we have every reason to believe she is still alive. There are witches still living in your world, most of them still serve her.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*This is why you can&#39;&#39;t let your guard down. Vera. If she ever found out a Spirit Wolf is still alive, she could try to use your magic to gain hers back. You cannot let this* *happen under any circumstance, do you understand?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod. The implication is very clear. I&#39;&#39;d rather die than give that bitch her powers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*If she were ever to gain her powers back, with the rest of us gone, there would be no stopping her. No lycan or werewolf would ever be a match for her.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*And what happened to my father?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both look at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*We have reason to believe he is also alive in your world, although we are not sure in what state. We haven&#39;&#39;t felt him since we felt your birth.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*And what about my mother? You said she was a werewolf?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ah yes, her name was Lilith. Your father met her once and felt the mate pull, even though witches don&#39;&#39;t have predestined mates. She was a very lovely girl.* My heart sinks at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Was?* I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My grandmother turns sad,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Unfortunately, she didn&#39;&#39;t survive long after you were born. You see, it takes a very special wolf to be able to breed with a warlock, and none ever made it out alive. It was**the curse of giving birth to a Spirit Wolf.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unwanted tears start streaming down my face. I didn&#39;&#39;t even know these people, but I just know they had to love me very much to give up so much for me to live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of a sudden, I feel very tired. The entire experience has worn me out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My aunt puts her hand on my forehead,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You should go now. A lot of magic is required to keep in the state you&#39;&#39;re in, it&#39;&#39;s drained you. You&#39;&#39;ll need a couple of hours to recuperate. Sweet dreams, my dear.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;&#39;s thest thing I remember her saying before everything goes dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;&#39;t know how long I sleep for, but when I wake up and peek through the window. everything is dark. Is this the same night? I turn to the other side of the bed, noticing Noah is gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get up from the bed feeling groggy, like I didn&#39;&#39;t rest at all. Maybe what my aunt said is true, being in their realm drains my magic and energy. Regardless, I get up from the bed and get dressed, heading downstairs to look for Noah. I find him looking out the kitchen window when I approach him. He turns around, sensing me, and puts his arms around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning, sleepy head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long was I asleep for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About 18 hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn my head up to look at him,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean I can&#39;&#39;t me you, we were at it all night; I must&#39;&#39;ve drained you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah...&#34; I narrow my eyes at him and heughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that tea I smell?&#34; I say, turning to the firece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, yes, Elden said it might help you? He was here a few hours ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grab the kettle and pour myself some tea. It smells amazing, and this time it has honey. I sigh, feeling better just by the scent alone. As I take a sip, it tastes like some type of flowery tea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sit by the couch and Noah joins me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you guys talk about?&#34; I ask him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not much, I think he was only interested in talking to you. He&#39;&#39;s a very odd old man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile at this. Yes, yes he is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were having a nightmare,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn to look at the tea cup in my hands, enjoying the warmth of it against my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was with my aunt and grandmother again. They showed me how spirit wolves were made.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks at me, waiting patiently for me to continue. My skin crawls just recalling the experience. I take a deep breath and tell him everything I saw and everything my aunt and grandmother told me. He stays quiet for a long time, looking into the fire. &#34;I knew witches were evil, but I underestimated them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They also said the Witch Mother is still alive, Noah. What if she&#39;&#39;s the one that created the Chimera? It had to be a powerful witch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More importantly, why would she create it in the first ce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was after lycans and then werewolves, both of which are needed to create spirit wolves, could she be trying to make more again?&#34; I shiver at the thought of this being true, but it&#39;&#39;s a possibility we have to consider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both sit in silence after this, each considering the implications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;&#39;s the case, it is even more important to get Alistair dealt with, soon. Lycans have to be strong enough if that witch ising back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod at this. With everything I have recently learned. I had almost forgotten about Alistair. The quicker we deal with him, the quicker I can visit Sofia to warn her and catch her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;&#39;s a knock on the door and Noah sits up to get it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;&#39;s probably Eli,&#34; he says, heading to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eli walks in, a grave expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; I question, noticing his demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Change of ns, kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He says as he sits on the dining table and Noah and I join him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, King Alistair is back. We finally know what he was doing while he was away,&#34; he pauses, something sour in his expression, &#34;he was gathering an army for hire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah and I turn to look at each other, shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many?&#34; Noah asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thousands, they haven&#39;&#39;t arrived yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both gape at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How does he even have the money to hire such an army?&#34; I question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;&#39;t, but they don&#39;&#39;t know that yet.&#34;</p>
