                <p>Chapter40</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stay at the castle&#39;&#39;s entrance until I can no longer see Noah, and even then, I&#39;&#39;m hesitant to move. The feeling in my stomach intensifies, almost making me nauseous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decide to give myself purpose while Noah is gone, so I n on making myself useful and digging up everything I can on King Alistair at the library, along with my research on witches. When I turn around, I find one of Noah&#39;&#39;s friends, Ezra, waiting for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Vera.&#34; Ezra seems like a genuinely nice guy, with thick curls, olive skin and very kind brown eyes. &#34;Lucas told me Noah was leaving, thought you might wantpany.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;&#39;s a polite way of saying &#39;&#39;babysitter&#39;&#39; but I&#39;&#39;ll take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Ezra, and yes, thank you, but I was actually wondering if you knew where Eli was?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm... that old man... he must be at the gym&#39;&#39;s office. Come, I&#39;&#39;ll show you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walk in silence, Ezra walks about two steps in front of me, hisrge body strategically shielding me from the other lycans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;m very grateful Noah&#39;&#39;s friends were willing to chaperone me while he&#39;&#39;s away; I&#39;&#39;m certain they have other more useful things to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walk into the gym, it is usually filled with people but for now, it seems like training is over and lycans are at work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ezra opens a door leading to a small office with two desks. One of the desks is empty, the other has Eli sitting at it, regarding us... regarding me... with an annoyed look. In truth, I&#39;&#39;m beginning to think that that&#39;&#39;s just his natural, resting face. &#34;Thank you. Ezra. Would you mind leaving us? I&#39;&#39;ll be safe with Eli.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ezra takes a look at Eli, gauging his reaction. Eli simply nods once, and Ezra is off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,e find any of us if you need anything.&#34; He tells me, genuinly meaning it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Ezra.&#34; I smile at him as he leaves, closing the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ie closer to Eli, taking a seat in front of him. He was reading some files and taking down notes before I came in. I take a look around his office; it is as sober as the man himself. There are no pictures, no windows, not even motivational posters hanging up. It is so unlike what I&#39;&#39;m used to. Every part of the Pack House was weing, even the training areas. Everything in this ce is rather purposed to make people feel ufortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;m in charge of their training. I have to make progress reports,&#34; he exins, gesturing towards the reports.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It makes sense that being an older lycan he isn&#39;&#39;t in active duty but rather training new recruits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why does the King want Noah dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eli&#39;&#39;s eyes go wide and he immediately gets up, peaking through the windows to make sure we&#39;&#39;re alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he sits back down, he definitely has an annoyed look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You better watch your mouth around here doc, ament like that could get us killed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;&#39;re alone, Eli. Why does he want Noah dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have no patience for any of this. None for his grumpy ass, none for Noah being in danger, none for murder plots and none for a *King* that has such little regard for one of his best warriors. Eli hasn&#39;&#39;t met this side of me yet, but I&#39;&#39;m beginning to get very angry about this whole situation and how ridiculous it is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stays silent for a long time, his eyes never leaving mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;&#39;t know. But I also don&#39;&#39;t think you&#39;&#39;re wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are the guys that went with him in the scouting mission? And what the fuck are they scouting for anyway?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Witches.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gives me a long look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Witches.&#34; I repeat, in disbelief. &#34;He sent a total of six lycans, to hunt for a witch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;&#39;t make sense to me either, doc. But that&#39;&#39;s what the King decided, we just follow orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are the lycans that went with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;&#39;re phenomenal fighters. I trained them myself, just as I trained Noah. They&#39;&#39;ll be good backup if anything should happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But they&#39;&#39;re not friends, hell I don&#39;&#39;t even think they *like* Noah, so tell me, who *are* they, and why would the King pick them specifically to go with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, Eli doesn&#39;&#39;t have an answer for this because he&#39;&#39;s just staring at me, making my patience run even thinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get up suddenly, startling him out of his thoughts. I make my way to the door, it&#39;&#39;s clear to me that this was a dead end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; hees after me, &#34;not here, it isn&#39;&#39;t safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know a ce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step out in front of him. Eli has dropped his annoyed look and is following closely behind. The few lycans we encounter lower their gaze as they see us pass, clearly out of respect for Eli.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We make our way through many corridors, almost like a maze, but finally we reach my intended destination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open therge doors leading to the library with one big push.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we step inside, I take a seat at one of the furthest tables from the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eli takes a look around, even sniffing the air, making sure we&#39;&#39;re really alone, before hees and joins me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality, we aren&#39;&#39;t alone. Council Member Elden is probably somewhere around and is aware of our presence.Contentt bel0ngs to N0ve/lDra/ma.O(r)g!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I also think the King has it against Noah, I warned him about it a long time ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, and what&#39;&#39;s that about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitates, looking over his shoulder as if someone were spying on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I&#39;&#39;m about to tell you does not leave this room. Understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I simply nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has to do with Noah&#39;&#39;s father.&#34;</p>
