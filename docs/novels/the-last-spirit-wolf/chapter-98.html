                <p>Chapter98</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The punch disorients me for a few seconds, not understanding exactly where it came from or from whom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The force with which it sent me flying almost makes me suspicious that it was Lucas, but my suspicions areid to rest when the figurees over me, attempting to punch me more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stupid whore!&#34; Cecil screams as shees over me, pinning me to the ground and throwing punches at my face, forcing me to protect myself with my arms, &#34;you were supposed to turn into your wolf, you dumb bitch!&#34; What the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock quickly subsides and it allows me to think quickly; I have to get her off of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raise my knees from under her, arching my back to dive them into her stomach and remove myself from under her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;&#39;s heavier than I expected and solidly nted to the ground, but I manage to get her off and put some distance between us after a few seconds of struggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You crazy bitch,&#34; I say as I spit the blood that was pooling inside my mouth from her punches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look over to the fighting ring and Violet is being tended to by the maids who have covered her naked body with a nket. Something catches my eye though; one of the maids that is tending to her has a striking resemnce to the figure my wolf and I sawst night. Now that I focus on her, my ears begin to ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cecil throws another punch at me; and then another and another, breaking my concentration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever that girl is, I will take care of her after putting this psycho down. I had only promised not to hurt Violet, Cecil on the other hand...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the corner of my eye, I notice Noah and the rest of the guys are being surrounded by the now mob-like crowd. Noah and I lock eyes, and we are both feeling the same thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intense anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head slightly, letting him know that I&#39;&#39;ll take care of Cecil and he nods, focusing back on the mob. None of them have turned into their lycan form, but Eli&#39;&#39;s and Noah&#39;&#39;s eyes are turning ck; evidently waiting for an attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why won&#39;&#39;t you turn?!&#34; Cecilnds a punch to my ribs, causing me to step back and cradle my torso with one arm as the other one is blocking her attacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, Cecil is a much more adept fighter than her daughter, strategically throwing punches and retreating when necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;&#39;s got nothing on me, though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I square up, tired of being defensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving quickly, I lower myself when I get close to Cecil, expecting her to throw a punch to stop me; when she does, Ind two powerful strikes to her belly, causing her to take a few steps back. Not allowing her an inch of relief, I once againe for her, this time kicking her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her legs don&#39;&#39;t buckle and she takes advantage of our closeness to try andnd a strike to my face. I block it with my left arm, using my right fist to punch her in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, she takes a few steps back, but this time she reads my next move and fools me into believing she is going to punch again; instead, she strikes me with her leg right on the wounds that her daughter inflicted on me before. &#34;Motherfu-&#34; I curse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smirks to herself, satisfied, but she makes one terrible mistake; she puts distance between us. Taking advantage of this, I put my hands on the floor, taking her by surprise, and gyrate my body so that my feet hit her stomach and jaw. Then,ing to a squat on the ground. I use my legs to catapult myself straight at her, headbutting her in the jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She staggers back, nursing her now inmed and bloody mouth. I can&#39;&#39;t say I&#39;&#39;m in much better condition; I feel that my face is also swollen and my legs are still bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; She roars furiously and turns into her lycan, ripping through her dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take the opportunity to run towards the fighting ring, looking for a weapon. I can&#39;&#39;t see my spear anywhere, so I take Violet&#39;&#39;s sword instead.This belongs to N?velDrama.Org - ?.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hairs on my nape rise as Ceciles near me, so I quickly turn around and duck, flinging the sword in her general direction; fortunately, it manages to leave a nasty wound on her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;&#39;s panting; I don&#39;&#39;t know if out of tiredness or anger. Then, she roars loudly like a mad animal and I have to cover my ears at the noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, that answers my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheunches at me again and again, her lycan making her more agile and powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In my mind, I feel my wolf inching closer to the surface; she&#39;&#39;s growling with her canines fully showing. She&#39;&#39;s as angry as I am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Easy now,* I tell her in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;&#39;t let her get too close to the surface or my eyes will begin to change and for anyone paying close attention and with enough knowledge, that will be a dead giveaway for what I really am. Then, the figure I had seen previously, the maid that had been tending to Violet,es back into the courtyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Queen! You can use the powder even if she doesn&#39;&#39;t turn!&#34; She yells.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Powder? What powder?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cecil&#39;&#39;s lycan smirks sadistically as the girl tosses her a little leather pouch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cecil rips it open with her teeth and throws it at me. Itnds directly on my chest, powder spreading all over me in a thick cloud that limits my visibility. It&#39;&#39;s a green-grey tale that smells absolutely disgusting. All of the moring dies down as everyone turns to me, expectant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the heck is this thing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cecil doesn&#39;&#39;t move an inch and that stupid smirk of hers only grows wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the cloud of powder dissipates, my eyes begin to slightly sting and my breathing isbored; I begin to scrunch my nose at the sensation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, I let out a thunderous sneeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever this thing is, it gave me freaking allergies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is wrong with you, you crazy bitch?!&#34; I tell her as I rub my itchy nose, exasperated with her antics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face falls; I&#39;&#39;m assuming this is not the reaction she expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turns quickly towards the girl and so do I; her face is pale and she&#39;&#39;s taking several steps back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I- I&#39;&#39;m sorry, it should have worked! I don&#39;&#39;t know what happened!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I narrow my eyes at her; was this supposed to poison me? Incapacitate me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn my head towards Noah and the rest of them; everyone has been paying close attention at the scene unfolding in front of them. I lock eyes with Eli and nod in the girl&#39;&#39;s direction, he nods back and I know he understood; we need to get her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She begins running, but so does Eli and she&#39;&#39;s no lycan. None of the other people present care enough about her to save her, they&#39;&#39;re much too concerned with Cecil and myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I y with the sword in my hand; I&#39;&#39;m tired of this shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34; I draw Cecil&#39;&#39;s attention away from where the girl has taken off running; she turns to me and I sprint towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using her distraction against her as I realize she won&#39;&#39;t be able to predict my move; instead of attacking her head on as she assumes I will, I go to my knees, passing below her legs. I stand up quickly, before she realizes where I&#39;&#39;ve gone, and sink the sword deep into her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She screeches in pain, wing frenziedly at her back trying to remove the sword unsessfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the corner of my eye, I spot my spear; one of the members of the crowd is holding it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk towards him and he steps back on impulse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I extend my hand towards the man who is looking at me with a stupefied look on his face. He carefully hands me my weapon and I make my way back to Cecil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She has now turned into her human form and has managed to remove the sword from her shoulder; she&#39;&#39;s nursing her arm carefully. I made sure to insert the sword in her scap. something I know is debilitatingly painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Submit.&#34; I tell her as I approach her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looks at me defiantly,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never,&#34; she seethes.</p>

                <p>&#34;Did you not hear me, mutt? Never!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Submit,&#34; I say yet again,pletely calm and inching closer to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would rather die!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn to Noah, Caleb, and Eli; they all have a resolute look on their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah nods once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you wish,&#34; I say, turning to Cecil and lifting my spear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refuses to close her eyes and decides to stare at me, challenging, waiting to be struck down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lift it and just as I&#39;&#39;m about to strike her down, a voice calls from within the crowd, halting me. &#34;STOP!&#34; It yells.</p>
