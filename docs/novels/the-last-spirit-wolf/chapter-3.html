                <p>I wake up at the crack of dawn the next day feeling incredibly rested. It is sofortable underneath</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the sheets that I dare not even open my eyes. What was I just dreaming about? I seem to have</p>
                
                
                
                <p>forgotten already.</p>

                <p>Sofia mind links me, sensing I’m awake. I go radio silent on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Girl! If you don’t get your ass into my office in the next ten minutes, I’m going in there and dragging you</p>

                <p>I’m angry she would y that card on me. I grumble and get up to my bathroom to wash my teeth and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>face. I won’t even bother changing for her, even though it’s the same clothes I left the hospital with and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the same clothes I slept in. I brush my hair, put on my tennis shoes and head out.</p>

                <p>themselves with breakfast, greet them good morning and make my way to the Alpha’s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knock softly on the ancient wooden door. Sofiamands me inside and I’m greeted by our Beta,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thomas, her mate, Alex, and the rude lycan fromst night. My stoic expression gives nothing away,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>not even how I’m immediately irritated that he’s here. I bow my head in respect at our Alpha and ce</p>
                
                
                
                <p>my hands behind my back, understanding this isn’t a social call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Vera, I’m sorry to call you in so early, but we have matters to discuss.” I wait patiently as she gathers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her thoughts. “You were right, something was…off… yesterday, but it wasn’t on our side of the border.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the scouts got closer and closer to the border limit, they started smelling blood, lots of it. They</p>
                
                
                
                <p>merely observed and came back to me. But… ten of them… ten of our wolves hadn’te back and it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was gettingte. We were about to send a hunting party to search for them until Eric mind linked me,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>telling me they wereing in hot with hurt wolves and hurt lycans.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next one to speak is Thomas, who oversees the hunting parties,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ording to Eric and the other wolves, they came across three lycans very close to our territory,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fighting ...something…” he nces at the lycan and continues, “whatever it was, it chased them into</p>
                
                
                
                <p>our territory and as our wolves defended our border from…it…it also started attacking them. As you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>saw, some were hurt pretty bad, but none were killed -”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Your wolves saved us, and I am forever grateful for your assistance. I only wish I could be of more</p>
                
                
                
                <p>help deciphering what the hell was attacking us in the first ce.” Apparently, the brute can speak and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>not insult us. We all look at him and Sofia speaks next, breaking the awkward silence that had followed,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Vera, did the lycan you operate on say anything about this? About what it might’ve been?” I take a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>moment to go through the events ofst night in my head, thinking hard on anything anyone could’ve</p>
                
                
                
                <p>said that could shed light on this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, sorry. He came in unconscious and his two friends copsed next to his bed.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But he did whisper something to you, I saw as much.” I didn’t realize this lycan was also awake when I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was treating my patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Nothing that could help us now, really.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What did he whisper?” Asks Sofia curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mate.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone is staring at me in utter confusion and the lycan narrows his eyes. I feel like this is a foot in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the mouth moment and frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean any offense, did something happen to his mate?” I ask, not understanding their</p>
                
                
                
                <p>reactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He doesn’t have a mate,” the lycan speaks through gritted teeth. I’m about to reply but Sofia mind links</p>
                
                
                
                <p>me once again,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he referring to you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How the hell would I know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did you feel… anything? When you touched him? When you looked at him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawns on me. The only time I touched him, with bare hands, I did feel a current beneath my</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fingertips. Sofia and I just stare at each other, understanding crossing both of our faces. Alex clears his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well, that’s not very useful,” says Sofia, deep in thought. After a few seconds of silence, she gives me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a look I know very well, “Vera could you…ask?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all stare at her, not understanding what she’s asking of me. The lycan scoffs probably thinking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she means for me to ask his friend. I smile gently at her and bow my head, she returns my smile and I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>take my leave. Sofia is my best friend, and she has seen first-hand how connected I am to nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She’s asking me to ask the forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain has turned into a drizzle as I run towards the edge of the forest. Once I’m about half a mile in,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bare my feet and crouch down; one hand goes into the soil, the other open palm onto the deepest-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>rooted tree I could find. I breathe in, every hair on my body standing to attention. My nostrils re once</p>
                
                
                
                <p>again as I turn my head on the direction the wind is blowing. I start getting shes, images, emotions,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>all conveyed through the wind and the soil. I dig deeper, wanting more, wanting answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I see it all too clearly. Something invisible, made obvious only through faint shadows and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>prints on the ground, viciously attacking a big group of lycans; crushing, scratching, biting, gruesomely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>tearing into flesh, and helpless lycans whimpering in pain. There were many more, but only three made</p>

                <p>it to us. I see many lycans dead on the ground, and others taking theirst breaths without even</p>
                
                
                
                <p>knowing what happened. The grass is littered with bodies, extremities, and so, so much blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stand up abruptly, not wanting to see more. I had begun to cry through the vision and now I can’t stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel their pain as if it was my own. I hug myself, trying to regain some warmth after what I just saw. I’m</p>
                
                
                
                <p>shaking uncontrobly and my breaths are shallow. What beast could do so much damage? To lycans</p>
                
                
                
                <p>of all creatures?</p>
