                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beast begins charging at me full speed and I have to say, I&#39;&#39;m d I run about 10 miles a day or else I&#39;&#39;d be chimera lunch by now. Despite all the wolves attacking and all the lycans. charging at it, its sole intent is on getting to me and killing me. Out of nowhere, I hear more wolves running our way. They&#39;&#39;reing from the direction of the pack house. Soon, about fifty wolves are emerging to the clearing, fangs bared; they must be the ones that were guarding the other borders. I have to be quick about this, we can&#39;&#39;t leave the borders unprotected for too long and I can&#39;&#39;t risk losing any more wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I make my way to the wolves as they are charging towards the beast, recognizing their lieutenant quickly. I make my way to him, knowing the beast will be busy for a few seconds with the iing wave of attacking wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to buy me time, I need that spear that&#39;&#39;s in its eye!&#34; I tell him, Desperation is starting to take over me as I see more and more wolves on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lieutenant nods its head and charges towards the beast, managing to get its fangs deeply into the leg of the beast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I run over to where Noah, Lucas and Eli are getting up from the floor. I get on my knees to look Noah in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah, I need you tounch me towards the spear.&#34; All three beasts stare at me in disbelief. &#34;I know how that sounds, but I need to retrieve it to blind its other eye, at least then we have a fighting chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah hesitates for a minute, but is quick to get on his feet. He picks me up, carrying me towards the beast. Once we are close enough and on its side, he puts his huge paw on my torso. Thank the Goddess for core strength, because he carries me from my mid torso like I&#39;&#39;m a spear myself, andunches me into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I&#39;&#39;munched into the air, it is clear to me that Noah overestimated my weight and his strength, because I amunched straight up, looking at the beast from below, nowhere near my target. However, once I&#39;&#39;m there, with this vantage point, I see a very bright dot on the top of its head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some reason, I feel a pulse of energy emanating from the bright light, like this is where the strength of the beast ising from; that&#39;&#39;s my target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I descend to the ground, far from the beast, and Eli is right there to catch me. His silver coat making him stand out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you&#39;&#39;re not the one who taught Noah how to throw.&#34; He scoffs and positions me to beunched directly at the spear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;m in the air, in direct trajectory to the face of the creature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He has perfect aim and fortunately the beast didn&#39;&#39;t notice me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Itch myself onto the spear, the pull on its eye ball making the beast cry out in pain and shake its head furiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my feet on its face to leverage myself and take out the spear. Once I do, I use my free arm to hold on to the beast&#39;&#39;s furry cheek. It attempts to w at me, only managing to scratch itself deeply on its face as I crawl up to the top of its head. I make quick of my climbing expedition and once I reach my destination, I can see the dot of bright light; it is encrusted into the beast itself, it&#39;&#39;s in its skull, throughyers andyers of hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raise the spear with both hands and ram it in the direction of the light, making the beast even more frantic and it tries to get rid of me and defend itself from the onught of wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spear can only reach halfway, so I pull it back and position myself to try again. However, the beast is now on its knees doing all it can to stop me. I&#39;&#39;m dodging its hands as I try to get a better angle to ram the spear into, almost slipping off its head a few times. I manage to get to the spot again by holding on to its thick fur. The wolves and lycans are doing the best to stop it, getting their cues from where I&#39;&#39;m at in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get a better position and once again take advantage of the distraction and ram the spear with all of my strength into the light again. A horrible shriek is heard from the beast, meaning I&#39;&#39;m getting closer to the light, but it isn&#39;&#39;t dead yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to reach deeper, I need to dig the spear deeper, but as much as I try, it just isn&#39;&#39;t enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;m not strong enough to do this myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frantically start looking below, desperate for a solution, for help, when I feel arge body crawling over me and every nerve on my body bes aware. I don&#39;&#39;t have to look to know it&#39;&#39;s Noah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hees up, his body over mine, and starts pushing the spear with me, the beast shrieking even louder. Noah and I are using all of our strength but the thick skull of the beast is proving to be stronger than both of us. I start worrying that the spear itself will break before we can destroy this thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of my eye I see Eli crawling towards us, positioning himself next to Noah and algo grabbing on to the spear and pushing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between the three of us, it is barely enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it *is* enough.N?velDrama.Org ? content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spear rips into the light and the beast falls to the ground with arge thud, onest nasty shrieking from it. All three of us fall to the ground along with it, Noah protecting me as we fall. We rolled on the ground, breathing heavily, our faces up towards the sky un utter exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;&#39;s finally over.</p>
