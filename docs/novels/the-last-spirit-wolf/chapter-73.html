                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah and I go to Elden, concerned with hisck of response when we called him over. He hasn&#39;&#39;t said a word and is looking like he&#39;&#39;s seen a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we&#39;&#39;re in front of him, he&#39;&#39;s still unresponsive and Noah and I look at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elden...&#34; Noah says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elden snaps out of his trance and he looks at both of us, then all of our surroundings. He doesn&#39;&#39;Content ? provided by N?velDrama.Org.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>t say a word, he only gestures at us to follow. Of course, we are headed to see Beta Caleb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we enter the room, he&#39;&#39;s asleep in the middle of the bed, breathing passively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was hoping he&#39;&#39;d still be awake when we returned,&#34; Elden says. &#34;Elden, what&#39;&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The tea worked, Vera. It worked!&#34; He&#39;&#39;s keeping his voice down for Caleb&#39;&#39;s sake but the excitement in his tone is clear, &#34;I gave him the tea immediately after you brought it to me. I know we said we&#39;&#39;d do more research but I didn&#39;&#39;t think it could hurt. I was right! You were right!&#34; &#34;Anyone care to fill me in?&#34; Noah says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We move to sit at the small table where Elden and I had wine earlier. I notice there&#39;&#39;s a blue tea in the middle of it; it&#39;&#39;s the same scent from the moon peonies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I brought Elden some moon peonies petals earlier today. My ears were ringing and it was the flowers calling me and I just had a hunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The... the flowers were calling you?&#34; He cocks an eyebrow at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I roll my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know how it sounds, but back when Charlotte&#39;&#39;s garden was destroyed, so were the moon peonies. I managed to bring them back to life and not only did they bloom, they flourished and multiplied.   I&#39;&#39;m certain it was because I used magic to do it even if I didn&#39;&#39;t know that&#39;&#39;s what it was at the time. So, I guess there&#39;&#39;s some magic in them? Is that what&#39;&#39;s happening?&#34; I turn to Elden with my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;L... I don&#39;&#39;t know.&#34; Elden says, looking down at the tea, &#34;I tried it myself before giving it to him, of course, and nothing happened. So, I gave it to him and in a few minutes it&#39;&#39;s as if he was back to his former self. It was incredible. It didn&#39;&#39;tst long, of course, this will take time, but it worked, Vera.&#34; Elden is tearing up as he says this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he say anything? About... my parents?&#34; Noah asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elden turns to him with a very serious expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah. You *are* King Alexander&#39;&#39;s son, the rightful heir to the throne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah releases a long breathe and runs his hand through his face. I just stare at him, trying to figure out what he&#39;&#39;s thinking now that we have confirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment passes and he speaks again,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And did Chirp shed any light on why my birth was kept a secret for so long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elden&#39;&#39;s expression is grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because, Noah, your mother was not a noblewoman, but she was nheless King Alexander&#39;&#39;s mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If she was his fated mate, why does it matter that she wasn&#39;&#39;t of noble birth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because she was a wolf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw drops to the floor. Noah&#39;&#39;s jaw drops to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Noah says, incredulous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard me correctly. ording to Caleb, your mother was a wolf. She was of noble birth in wolf society, so she was mated to the Alpha of her pack against her will. When she met your father, it was clear that they were fated mates but she was already married. She escaped to join your father, but in order to not create conflict with her pack, all of this had to be a secret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah runs his hand through his hair, shocked at the revtion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You keep referring to her in past tense, what happened to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elden with my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;L... I don&#39;&#39;t know.&#34; Elden says, looking down at the tea, &#34;I tried it myself before giving it to him, of course, and nothing happened.

                <p>Elden turns to him with a very serious expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah. You *are* King Alexander&#39;&#39;s son, the rightful heir to the throne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah releases a long breathe and runs his hand through his face. I just stare at him, trying to figure out what he&#39;&#39;s thinking now that we have confirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment passes and he speaks again,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And did Chirp shed any light on why my birth was kept a secret for so long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elden&#39;&#39;s expression is grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because, Noah, your mother was not a noblewoman, but she was nheless King Alexander&#39;&#39;s mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If she was his fated mate, why does it matter that she wasn&#39;&#39;t of noble birth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because she was a wolf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw drops to the floor. Noah&#39;&#39;s jaw drops to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*What?*&#34; Noah says, incredulous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard me correctly. ording to Caleb, your mother was a wolf. She was of noble birth in wolf society, so she was mated to the Alpha of her pack against her will. When she met your father, it was clear that they were fated mates but she was already married. She escaped to join your father, but in order to not create conflict with her pack, all of this had to be a secret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah runs his hand through his hair, shocked at the revtion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You keep referring to her in past tense, what happened to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;m sorry, we didn&#39;&#39;t get to talk as much, that&#39;&#39;s all I got from him. Then I think the effect wore off and he went back to being... Chirp. He&#39;&#39;s been asleep since.&#34; Elden says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head is reeling at the revtion. Not only is Noah the rightful King, but he is also half wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We would still need to prove this before bringing it to the Council, or anyone else for that matter, and I&#39;&#39;m afraid Beta Caleb&#39;&#39;s testimony won&#39;&#39;t be of much use in this state,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elden nods,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but now I at least have a lead to look into to prove your parentage, Noah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all stay silent for a long while after, processing what this all means.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In theory, not much changes. Noah is already King, albeit against the Council&#39;&#39;s wishes. But having proof of who he is will give them no other choice than to support him fully and recognize him as the true heir to the throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, we hear a stomach growl. It&#39;&#39;s Noah&#39;&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I think that&#39;&#39;s our cue to go. Elden, please let us know if you find anything else or if Beta Caleb says anything else,&#34; Noah says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elden nods and Noah and I make our way to the dining hall once again, hoping maybe there is some food left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we get there, there isn&#39;&#39;t much but someone left him some meat pastries in the pantry, neatly covered up. One of the cooks must have seen that he didn&#39;&#39;t get to eat; now that he&#39;&#39;s King, it&#39;&#39;s natural for everyone to be hyper aware of him and his needs. &#34;Let&#39;&#39;s just go to our room. I&#39;&#39;m tired and I don&#39;&#39;t feel like sitting here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile and nod, also sneaking to the cer to grab some wine as well as some coffee mugs from the counter; it&#39;&#39;s the only thing I could find in ways of a cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a feeling we might need this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiles at me and puts his arm on my shoulders as we make our way to the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once there, we each get undressed and into some form of pajamas. He usually only wears pants or his underwear and I settle for one of his oversized t-shirts. As he digs into his food, I take the wine, open it and pour it into the mugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you manage all of this when you found out about your parents?&#34; He asks as we sip the wine and he finishes his food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? The existential crisis? The abandonment issues? You have to be specific,&#34; I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything.&#34; heughs and leans back on the headboard. &#34;I have not known myself a single day in my life for thest 26 years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah, you&#39;&#39;re still you, regardless of who your parents were. And I saw the way you handled the Council in the meeting, you are a natural leader. None of that changes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never wanted any of this, you know? I never wanted the throne, I never wanted to head the Council or an entire *kingdom* for that matter&#34; he pauses, &#34;I wonder if my parents had raised me would I feel any different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you already feel responsible for everyone as it is, otherwise you wouldn&#39;&#39;t have epted this. And what is it to be King if not to sacrifice for your people?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stay chatting for a couple of hours more,ughing as Noah told me everything that happened during lunch. It&#39;&#39;s been a long day, for both of us, so I&#39;&#39;m hoping this wine helps us both get some sleep.</p>
