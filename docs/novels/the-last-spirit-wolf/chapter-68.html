                <p>Chapter68</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pregnant silence follows Elden&#39;&#39;s shocking reveal. Nobody is moving, it feels like nobody is even breathing. I look over to Noah who is looking between Elden and Chirp- Beta Caleb with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence is interrupted by a loud chirping noise,ing from Beta Caleb, followed by manicughter. &#34;Vera, help me take him to his room, quick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elden steps to Beta Caleb&#39;&#39;s other side and we quickly leave the courtyard, heading towards the stairs. Beta Caleb continuesughing and sagging against us. Getting him up the stairs takes a few minutes but we manage to do it, walking quickly to one of thergest rooms in the castle: the Beta&#39;&#39;s chambers. &#34;Here, I&#39;&#39;ll hold him, you open the doors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doors are naturally stuck from being shut for so many years, a thickyer of grime and dusting from under the doors when I finally manage to open them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elden walks inside with Beta Caleb,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut the door behind us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I enter the room and do as I&#39;&#39;m told.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remove the top sheets, please. This bed smells disgusting.&#34; he tells me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again, I do as he tells me and remove the topyers of the bedding which are indeed dirty beyond imagination. The bed itself however isn&#39;&#39;t that bad; it&#39;&#39;s been protected from the dust all these years by theyers I just removed. Elden moves Beta Caleb and sits him on the edge of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay here,&#34; he tells me, retreating to the door, &#34;don&#39;&#39;t let him leave, and don&#39;&#39;t let anyone see him like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod, dumbfounded. I&#39;&#39;m still processing what just happened out there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beta Caleb, Alistair&#39;&#39;s father and former Beta to King Alexander... is alive. He&#39;&#39;s not only alive, but he&#39;&#39;s gone insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sits right now on the edge of the bed just staring absently at the space in front of him; he doesn&#39;&#39;t even seem to recognize his own room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I keep myself busy by making sure the lights in the room work and that there is running water in the bathroom. I don&#39;&#39;t know how long Beta Caleb has gone without a proper bath, but it seems like it&#39;&#39;s been a while; he smells like the dungeons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I&#39;&#39;m preparing a bath, there&#39;&#39;s a knock on the door. The hairs on my arms stand in awareness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go to open the door and Noah is waiting outside rather sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can Ie in?&#34; He asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open the door wider for him toe in and join us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elden is gone, Goddess knows where, I&#39;&#39;m hoping hees back soon.&#34;This belongs to N?velDrama.Org - ?.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah steps forward in the room, regarding Beta Caleb and his absent stare into nothingness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has moments of lucidity, I noticed it too back in the dungeons, but I could have never imagined...&#34; he trails off, &#34;how could he do this to his own father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know exactly what he means.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know what this means?&#34; Noah continues, &#34;the answer was right under our noses the entire time, and we had no idea. A Beta is perfectly capable of taking over Royal duties without incident.   All of these years, all this time, wasted under Alistair&#39;&#39;smand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah, there was no way any of you could&#39;&#39;ve known. Alistair kept him very well hidden, and if he didn&#39;&#39;t want him found, he was never going to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think there was a reason for it. Back in the cells, he was telling me about a two year old boy he hid, and said that he was the rightful king.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The rightful King? How is that possible? King Alexander didn&#39;&#39;t have a son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Beta Caleb snaps his head, turning to look at us. It takes us both by surprise and we shup up, expecting him to say something, but he doesn&#39;&#39;t. He just stares at us, primarily focused on Noah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few minutes, Noah moves closer to him carefully as to not scare him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Chirp, how are you feeling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha. Chirp. That&#39;&#39;s my name,&#34; he says with humor, carefully watching Noah as he approaches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah crouches down in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember that boy you were telling me about? The boy-would-be-King? You need to tell me where to find him. I have no intentions of keeping the throne from a rightful heir. Do you remember where you hid him?&#34; &#34;Noah...&#34; I caution. It isn&#39;&#39;t wise to fluster someone who is mentally unstable. Perhaps after some treatment and therapy this question won&#39;&#39;t be overwhelming, but as it stands, it could make him snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beta Caleb starts rocking back and forth in the bed, staring directly at Noah but not saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah, I think we better let him rest, I&#39;&#39;m drawing a bath for him maybe that will calm him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I&#39;&#39;m saying that, Eldenes in through the door with a basket filled with herbs. I can smell chamomile, lemongrass,vender and many others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh good, you&#39;&#39;re already drawing a bath,&#34; he says and proceeds to the bathroom to dunk all of the herbs into the water, stirring them in with his hand, &#34;help me get him in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go forward to help him but Noah stops me,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;ll do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carries Beta Caleb to the bathroom, ridding him of the horrible robe he was wearing, then he carefully puts him in the bathtub where Elden is waiting with a sponge. &#34;There, there. This will make you feel better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elden is bathing Beta Caleb carefully and Noah and I step out of the bathroom to give him some privacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do you think he could have hidden such a boy? A Royal baby can&#39;&#39;t be easily hidden. much less a toddler.&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;&#39;t even know if it&#39;&#39;s true, V. He might just be delusional; maybe all those years in the dungeons altered his memories. Besides he&#39;&#39;d be what? 25 or 26 already? Surely he would&#39;&#39;ve imed the throne by now.&#34; About twenty minutes go by until Elden emerges from the bathroom with Beta Caleb. He looks a lot better now that he&#39;&#39;s clean, and smells a lot better too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carefully, Eldenys him on the bed for him to rest, but as soon as he sees Noah again, he jolts up; this time, he&#39;&#39;s tearing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I served my King. I served my King well. Oh Elden, will you tell him? Will you tell the King I saved his boy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elden is looking at him perplexed,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb, our King had no children, he was unmated,&#34; he says gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! No no no! He had a son, a hidden mate. For two years I kept the secret of his birth, and for twenty-four years I kept the secret of his existence from my boy. Please tell him I did good. please tell him to forgive my boy.&#34; He has tears flowing freely down his cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are staring at him, confused. Elden tries to shush him gently but he won&#39;&#39;t stop crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will, my friend, I will, but then tell me, where is this boy you speak of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a very serious expression, Beta Caleb raises a shaky hand and points it at Noah.</p>
