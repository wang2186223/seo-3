                <p>-Noah-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Warrior Noah! Those are very serious usations you&#39;&#39;re making against his Highness the King!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Do you have any proof?!&#34; Council Member William says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unfortunately, no, I killed all witnesses,&#34; I say indifferently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is sphemous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you speak to your King in that manner?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Council Members are outraged while I pick at my ear unceremoniously, further infuriating all of them. This whole acting thing is fun, actually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gentlemen, please, I can only ry what I was told. The only reason why I came back was to search for answers, otherwise, why not follow my mate to wolf territory? Or are the rumors untrue, your highness? Did you not try to force yourself onto my mate in my absence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More shocked whispers by the crowd and now even some Council Members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I know *everything* you tried to do to her, I&#39;&#39;m d she beat your ass before you could do anything. How does it feel to lose to a girl, your Highness?&#34; I say, my voice heavy as my lycan. has begun to surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Council Member William turns to the King,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your... your Highness... is this true? Did you try to pursue a Wolf?&#34; He&#39;&#39;s whispering discreetly, but we can all hear his question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the King is irate,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You woulde back, Warrior Noah, with wild usations and no proof?! Where is that mate of yours to offer her testimony, huh?! Or is that unmarked wench still rejecting you?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grind my teeth. Don&#39;&#39;t f**k up now, Noah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mate is safely back home, but I therefore, Your Highness, challenge you to a duel for my mate&#39;&#39;s honor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ording to lycan code, as a King he cannot reject a direct challenge like this, but then again he is no real King. &#34;Preposterous! Guards! OFF WITH HIS HEAD!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King is so angry he spits out thest words of his sentence. The guards loyal to him approach me and lean me into the guillotine, cing my head on the nook of the half moon. I close my eyes; this is the moment of truth. The only one who wasn&#39;&#39;t being closely monitored by those loyal to the King was Vera, which is why she&#39;&#39;s the only one that can make the first move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat drips down my forehead as the crowd is going wild. Some are expectant, others are horrified. The guard moves to unleash the rope that holds the guillotine in ce, but just as he&#39;&#39;s about to undo the knot, he falls to his knees, shrieking in pain and holding his wrist; his hand has been cleanly cut off. When I raise my head, it&#39;&#39;s Vera&#39;&#39;s spear that has incrusted itself in the wooden structure.N?velDrama.Org owns ? this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You can hear a pin drop in the courtyard with how silent it&#39;&#39;s turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, a distinctive battle yell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is our signal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the blink of an eye, the entire space has erupted into chaos. People are pushing themselves and tumbling over others to leave the courtyard and get to safety as lycansunch at each other. It&#39;&#39;s an us versus them now. One of the guards loyal to the Kinges for me in full lycan form but before he can approach me, he falls to the ground. Standing on his back as he falls is Vera holding a sword and... blood on her cheeks?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shees to me with the keys to my chains and frees my wrists. I rub them while studying the fighter marks on her face. She rolls her eyes,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;&#39;s Eli&#39;&#39;s blood, so that I&#39;&#39;m recognized by his scent. Don&#39;&#39;t even get me started, I&#39;&#39;m just happy I&#39;&#39;m an actual doctor and I&#39;&#39;ve had way worse on my face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile at her; it&#39;&#39;s just so good to see her again. Even in the middle of all of this, all I can focus on is her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch out!&#34; she says as she ducks and a lycanes tumbling onto the tform, searching for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;&#39;s Lenny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grin and let my lycan out in a split second. Oh, how I&#39;&#39;ve been waiting for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;&#39;t lose sight of the King!&#34; Vera yells at me as she&#39;&#39;s fighting off a female lycan that&#39;&#39;se for her. She makes quick work of her, having retrieved her spear and slicing the female&#39;&#39;s jugr.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmpf, one of Harriet&#39;&#39;s friends,&#34; she says disdainfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lennyunches himself at me, but he&#39;&#39;s always been a mediocre fighter at best. Still, I take my time with him, punching in his teeth just as I had wanted tost night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;m done with him in a minute and join Vera at the center of the tform, back to back. Lycans areing for us from all angles to try and kill us. I take a look around and it&#39;&#39;s a total bloodbath, yet I can say with confidence most of the blood is theirs. We are joined on the tform by Mason, Eva and Lucas who nod at Vera. She nods back and turns to me,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah, we&#39;&#39;ll cover for you, you know what you have to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn to look at all of my friends, fighting; not for me, but for themselves and the future they want to have. I nod at her and leap from the tform, fighting off a couple of guards and some other loyal servants to the King. I notice the Council has already scattered and fear that the King might have run away too, like the coward he is, but he hasn&#39;&#39;t. He&#39;&#39;s standing on his chair behind his two biggest guards; he hasn&#39;&#39;t moved an inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grin to myself. This is finally it. We will finally be rid of this fucker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continue to fight my way through the crowd, knocking some lycans unconscious and killing others. I lock eyes with the King and grin a wide, vicious grin. I&#39;&#39;m so close I can practically smell his fear. He signals for the guards toe to me, and they do, three at a time. I fight them off as theye, inching closer to the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the two massive guards that were closest to him are the only ones left. When they approach me, I note they easily double me in size.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kill him! Your Kingmands it!&#34; Alistair says. I can no longer see him as the two guards tower over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them makes the first move, smashing his hands on the ground as I leap up into the air. The other one punches me right in my torso as I&#39;&#39;m in the air, knocking the air out of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ok, so these won&#39;&#39;t be as easy as to deal with as the rest. I dodge attack after attack, hoping they&#39;&#39; Il get tired enough for me to attack, but the contrary happens; I&#39;&#39;m the one getting tired from evading them. It doesn&#39;&#39;t help that I was beaten mercilessly yesterday and I slept chained to a wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After several minutes of fighting off the guards, Eli joins me and together we are able to best the two massive guards. But in all of this ruckus, we lost sight of the target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I turn to look at where Ist saw the King, he isn&#39;&#39;t there anymore and nobody knows where he went.</p>
