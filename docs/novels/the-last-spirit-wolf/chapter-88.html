                <p>Chapter88</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean her eyes are white?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;&#39;t you see her wolf? Her fur is also pearl white... and... iridescent. I had never seen anything like it either.&#34; Caleb says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;m surprised by what he&#39;&#39;s saying. Having white fur for wolves is rare enough, but what he&#39;&#39;s describing is impossible. Noah c***s an eyebrow at Caleb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you weren&#39;&#39;t hallucinating? You had juste out of the spell and maybe you were seeing things,&#34; Noah says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;m not making anything up, you can ask that other kid that was with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah turns to me,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucas,&#34; I rify.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah frowns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That means you will also not be able to turn into your wolf in public, Vera,&#34; he points out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah, I already walked through the entire castle in my wolf form.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did what?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? You preferred they see me naked?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;&#39;t worry too much about it,&#34; Caleb interjects, &#34;not many people have been exposed to wolves as much as I have, many probably just think that&#39;&#39;s normal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would still like for no one to know she&#39;&#39;s half witch, I don&#39;&#39;t think it&#39;&#39;s safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or convenient.&#34; Caleb adds, &#34;I agree.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I roll my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing like men making decisions for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb clears his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it&#39;&#39;s better we all get some rest. The real work begins now. We can meet tomorrow to n the future steps to regain control of the territory the rogues have taken over and... the other thing.&#34; Noah stands up as Caleb does, both shaking hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me make one thing clear,&#34; Noah says, holding his hand firmly, &#34;I would rather give up the throne and all of this shit than take in a &#39;&#39;spouse&#39;&#39;. Vera is my mate, whether they like it or not. The *only* reason why I&#39;&#39;m having her hide her identity is because of fear for her safety, *not* because it&#39;&#39;s convenient to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah&#39;&#39;s stance is rxed, but there is a clear threat in his tone and my heart starts beating a little bit faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb sighs, briefly ncing at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quite frankly, I expect nothing less from Alexander&#39;&#39;s son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, they both release each other&#39;&#39;s hands and Caleb starts turning away, not before nodding my way and giving me a long look. I don&#39;&#39;t smile at him as I usually would; I feel like there&#39;&#39;s something he&#39;&#39;s not telling us and it&#39;&#39;s irking me. &#34;We really should get some rest,&#34; Noahes to me, extending his hand for me to take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod and get up, Noah noticing my frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vera, don&#39;&#39;t worry about it. Nobody is going toe between us, I won&#39;&#39;t let it happen. I mean it when I say I will never take in a spouse that isn&#39;&#39;t you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn to him, my frown deepening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah, just to be clear. I will kill any bitch that even attempts to flirt with you,&#34; heughs, &#34;It&#39;&#39;s not that, it&#39;&#39;s... do you feel like he&#39;&#39;s hiding something?&#34; &#34;Who? Caleb?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not really, I thought he was sincere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So do I, but there&#39;&#39;s something else, too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;&#39;s not think about that right now, let&#39;&#39;s go get some sleep. We have meetings tomorrow; they start early.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take his hand and smile at him, reassuringly. It does little to ease my nerves though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we get to our room, we each change andy in bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah is soon rolling to his side and putting his big arm around me, already half asleep. I cuddle into him, my back to his chest. I rx and focus on his even, passive breathing until it lulls me to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I know why Mehra wanted Noah&#39;&#39;s family dead.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;m in my aunt and grandma&#39;&#39;s realm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Hi, Margaret,* I say, not amused. I really wanted a peaceful sleep tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Vera, I&#39;&#39;m sorry to bring you in, but we need to talk.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rub my eyes and look at her, giving her my full attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You already heard from Beta Caleb that Mehra used Alistair to dethrone King Alexander,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raise an eyebrow,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Who&#39;&#39;s Mehra?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*The witch you killed, the one controlling Alistair&#39;&#39;s army and the one who tricked him into believing she was his mate.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You said she wanted Noah&#39;&#39;s family dead?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yes. Ever since the battle, when Noah broke free from her spell, I&#39;&#39;ve been wondering if he could have a natural defense against magic since he still didn&#39;&#39;t have your mark and protection. It turns out, Noahes from a long line of warriors that fought against witches for generations; they were essentially witch hunters. They were a catalyst for the end of the age of witches and had, presumably, developed some form of resistance against magic.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now my interest has peaked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*So they wanted revenge on his family?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It&#39;&#39;s worse than that. There is a prophecy, Vera, that says that thest battle against witch kind will be led by the &#39;&#39;first son of the first son.&#39;&#39; Noah&#39;&#39;s ancestors were known to recruit the first son&#39;&#39;s of every willing family to fight against witches. The Witch Mother probably assumed that the prophecy referred to someone from Noah&#39;&#39;s family line. That&#39;&#39;s why they needed King Alexander killed, only they didn&#39;&#39;t know he&#39;&#39;d had a son.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest constricts at this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*So now that he&#39;&#39;s taking over the throne, and it&#39;&#39;s known that he&#39;&#39;s King Alexander&#39;&#39;s son...*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They will likelye for him again.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gulp, dread settling in my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;&#39;s not all,&#34; she says, &#34;chatter has begun. Vera. The witch&#39;&#39;s felt your magic when you turned into your wolf form. It seems that spirit wolves in their beast form are not only conductors for magic like us, they *are* magic itself. If you ever fell in the wrong hands...* She shutters before she can finish her sentence. Then, shees close to me and puts her hands on either side of my face, making me look into her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Vera, we will do everything we can to protect you and Noah. In the meantime, we suggest you keep a low profile. The witches know Mehra is dead, and they know there was a pure magical essence around her, but they don&#39;&#39;t know much else. I need you to go to the forest and burn whatever remains are left of her, to block out any chance of them knowing exactly where she is and finding out about you. We will also need to continue your training in here.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod, feeling overwhelmed at everything that she&#39;&#39;s telling me. We just got rid of Alistair, we just got rid of that witch, and we have so much on our tes already... to think of another battle... Margaret hugs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It will be fine, Vera. I promise.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hug her back, closing my eyes and taking in whateverfort she can offer me, but there is nothing she can do or say to reassure me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I open my eyes again, I am in Noah&#39;&#39;s embrace once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I carefully slip out of bed without waking him and put on some clothes and a hoodie, getting ready to go outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I make my way past the corridors of the castle, getting to the kitchen to retrieve some matches, paper, and oil. It&#39;&#39;s around four or five in the morning and the only people up right now are the guards. When I&#39;&#39;m at the exit, I greet the guards with a nod and they do the same, not questioning where I was going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get to the ce where we had fought Alistair and the witch, noticing that our warrior&#39;&#39;s bodies had indeed been removed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I keep walking until I find the ce where I killed the witch, Mehra. Her body is still here, dposing at an elerated rate. It doesn&#39;&#39;t even look like a young woman&#39;&#39;s body, it looks like an elderly one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dip the paper in the oil and attempt to light it up with the matches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You don&#39;&#39;t need that.* I hear a voice inside my head. *Grandma?* I think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yes. I can use your wolf as a direct channel to you even when you&#39;&#39;re awake. Put your hands in the soil, child, and think of the fire you want to create. What it will smell like, feel like, and how it will serve you.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I do as I&#39;&#39;m told and crouch down a few feet away from the witch&#39;&#39;s body. I close my eyes and take several deep breathes, calming my mind. Then, in one strong exhale, the fire starts around the witch&#39;&#39;s body, slowly making its way to my target. *Very good.* I hear in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile and get up, hugging myself and enjoying the warmth of the fire in this chilly night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun has begun to peek through the horizon and the forest is starting to be alive with the diurnal animals beginning to wake up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An ominous chill suddenly runs down my spine as the fire reaches the witch&#39;&#39;s body and ignites it in a ball of fire. Soon her bones are cracking under the pressure of the me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind starts blowing from the west and I turn my face towards it. A sense of forebodingN?velDrama.Org owns ? this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>settles in the pit of my stomach, almost making me nauseous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hug myself tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There is a war looming in the horizon.</p>
