                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before making my way to Charlotte&#39;&#39;s garden, I go by Lucas&#39;&#39;s room, looking for a babysitter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knock on the door, hopefully he&#39;&#39;s already off duty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear some rumbling inside the room and a shirtless Lucas opens the door, his hair disheveled. &#34;Oh, Vera, hi,&#34; he says. It seems I have taken him by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Lucas, I hope I&#39;&#39;m not interrupting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, not at all. Did something happen?&#34; He suddenly steps out of the room, scanning my surrounding He really is overprotective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I&#39;&#39;m a little perplexed by his actions, &#34;I was hoping you could apany me to Charlotte&#39;&#39;s garde Truthfully, the entire castle felt stuffy without Noah here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh! Right, sure! Give me a minute to get dressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shuts the door in my face. I mean I get it, it&#39;&#39;d look terrible if I, an unmated female, entered his room A minuteter he&#39;&#39;s out, this time fully dressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We make our way to the garden in silence. Once again, it&#39;&#39;s alreadyte and most of themon areas are When we enter the garden. I&#39;&#39;m surprised to see Charlotte tending to some nts. She&#39;&#39;s the only one han &#34;Lucas! Vera! Hi!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charlotte? Why are you here sote?&#34; Lucas is the first to ask her and approach her, though I&#39;&#39;m also &#34;Oh, I thought I&#39;&#39;d get some work done while Ethan finishes his shift. He&#39;&#39;s meeting me here once he&#39;&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile at this. During the dinner it was quite evident the connection they both had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas besides me yawns, quickly covering his mouth and trying to hide it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ed a little...fresh...air.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>deserted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>er head perks up when she notices us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ring the same thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucas, Ethan and I can walk Vera back to her and Noah&#39;&#39;s room once hees here, if it&#39;&#39;s alright with you,&#34; Charlotte speaks in her soft voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas turns to me, his eyes red and tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;&#39;s alright, Lucas. Go get some sleep, I&#39;&#39;m sorry for waking you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no, it&#39;&#39;s ok, any time. Charlotte are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; she smiles gently at him and I pat his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your babysitting duties are officially over, thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turns around as he yawns again, practically dragging his feet as he exits the garden. He closes the door before he leaves, leaving Charlotte and I alone. &#34;I&#39;&#39;m sorry to impose, Charlotte, I just needed...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fresh air?&#34; She smiles at me. I notice she does that a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; I smile back at her and take a seat next to where she had been working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They are a few nts I don&#39;&#39;t recognize. They&#39;&#39;re quite beautiful, quite green and their still unopened flower pods already smell so fragrant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are Moon Peonies, they&#39;&#39;re very rare around here. Ethan got them for me for our first anniversary. It takes them five years to bloom.&#34; &#34;That&#39;&#39;s amazing, they smell good already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Smell?&#34; She looks at me a bit bewildered, sniffing the flower pods from up close. &#34;I don&#39;&#39;t smell anything, must be your werewolf nose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frown. The smell is quite intense, I would think even a human nose would pick it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway,&#34; she continues to tend to her flowers, &#34;tell me, when does Noahe back? Ethan told me he&#39;&#39;d be gone for a couple of weeks. You&#39;&#39;re wee here any time, I know that castle can be a little stuffy.&#34;She crinkles her nose at this. I know exactly what she means.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I smile at her and continue, &#34;I&#39;&#39;m not sure, actually. He seemed sure he could be back sooner but, I don&#39;&#39;t know, really.&#34;N?velDrama.Org ? content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;m sorry, you must miss him a lot. Ethan and I aren&#39;&#39;t fated mates and I still miss him terribly when he&#39;&#39;s gone. I can&#39;&#39;t imagine what it&#39;&#39;s like for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at the mark at the base of her neck. Since they aren&#39;&#39;t fated mates, their connection muste directly from the marking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charlotte, can I ask you a... personal question?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What made you decide toe here with Ethan? It seems like such a dangerous ce for a human.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, same thing as you I suppose... Love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She keeps tending to her flowers so she can&#39;&#39;t notice my expression; If only she knew that&#39;&#39;s not entirely why I came here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The mark, it must&#39;&#39;ve hurt a lot if you heal like a human.&#34; I continue, diverting my train of thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand goes to her mark and she caresses it with her fingers, smiling at the memory of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;m not gonna lie, it is the worse pain I have ever experience, but when a lycan marks a human, part of their abilities are shared with their mate. In my case, I was fully healed the next day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sees the confusion in my face,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that not the same with werewolves?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest with you, I only ever met werewolf mates, I wouldn&#39;&#39;t know if our abilities are passed to human mates.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? I thought having human mates is rather normal, like with lycans. You see, there aren&#39;&#39;t many female lycans born, most of the time male lycans have to find human females, and that rarely produces Lycan children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;m shocked at this revtion; Charlotte is basically telling me the overall lycan poption is going down. I make a mental note to explore this topic further with Eli or Elden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charlotte and I keep making small talk. I was right the first time we met; I knew we would be quick friends. She&#39;&#39;s the nicest person I have encountered here other than Lucas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tells me about her childhood, how her parents nearly passed out when she told them she was marrying a lycan. How she knew that having children with him was a long shot but that she was willing to take a chance, and how Ethan was in fact the sweetest person she had ever met, despite what his friends might think of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Ethan arrives after his shift, both Charlotte and he take me back to my room, to Noah&#39;&#39;s room. I thank them and close the door as they turn to leave, hand in hand..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn around and face the room. This is the first night I&#39;&#39;ll be sleeping without Noah here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I change my clothes and put on one of his shirts; one that still smells like him, and crawl into bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For absolutely no reason, I begin crying into the pillow, the emptiness I feel consuming me, until sleep finally ims me.</p>
