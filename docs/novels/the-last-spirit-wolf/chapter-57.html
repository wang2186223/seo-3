                <p>Chapter57</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all turn to the voice and Eli steps into the cabin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eli...&#34; I get up to hug him, which takes us both by surprise; I&#39;&#39;m just very happy, and grateful, to see him alive and well. &#34;I&#39;&#39;m not an easy target, doc,&#34; he says as he pats me in my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We separate and Elden offers Eli a cup of tea, which he gratefully epts as hees from trekking in the cold. I move to grab a washcloth and clean the spilled tea on the table as Noah has now moved to look out one of the windows. Eli, Elden and I are sitting on the table, waiting for him to calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally speaks without turning from the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by &#34;n&#34; exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah, it&#39;&#39;s not new to you that the King isn&#39;&#39;t liked; I&#39;&#39;d even venture to say he is hated by the people, and not just within the castle. Many warriors deserted after King Alexander was killed, but they never stopped being warriors. They were just waiting for a worthy King to take over the throne toe serve again.&#34; Eli is looking at his cup of tea as he speaks, &#34;Noah, you *are* that worthy King.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah pinches the bridge of his nose with his fingers, but he finally turns to us and sits with us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We would need an army, Eli. We would need an army to match the goons of the King. And then what? Just establish myself as King? The Council would never ept me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Council are just a group of old hags who abide by tradition because it *serves* them, but in reality, there is no real benefit to a Council anymore,&#34; Elden says. &#34;Meaning?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meaning they either get on board or we get rid of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elden speaks of this in such a nonchnt manner, as if we&#39;&#39;re not just nning a coup over here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eli speaks next,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have an army; and they just might be enough to pull this off. I have been preparing for this moment since you were a boy; your potential was crystal clear to me from the start. Warriors outside and within the castle are just waiting for my call... waiting for your call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah stares at Eli for a long time, weighing what he just said. Then, he turns to me and my heart sinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vera, I know what we said, but we might have a real shot at taking Alistair down. Not only for what he did to you and what he almost did to me, but for all lycans now and in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes are pleading with mine, but I know he&#39;&#39;s already made up his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh and turn to Eli,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, how many are we talking about here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Couple hundred warriors, some of us are old, but we have a couple of tricks up our sleeves. Then, a great part of the warriors within the castle would also stand with you; you have earned their loyalty throughout the years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We could attack at night, but we&#39;&#39;d have to make sure that bastard doesn&#39;&#39;t run away through the tunnels,&#34; Noah says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could close them off. I know every entrance and exit better than anyone in the castle; it won&#39;&#39;t be a problem.&#34; Elden offers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right now, the King is not in the castle. Apparently, he had some business to attend to within the kingdom. But when hees back, we have to move quick,&#34; Eli says. &#34;Does he have any reason to believe Noah is still alive?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, not yet. That&#39;&#39;s why we have to move quick, before he starts wondering why none of the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>men came back either. He also has no reason to believe you&#39;&#39;re not back in werewolf territory. Once the Kinges back, we make our move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah turns to me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to stay here, V.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You what?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;&#39;t have you in the battle, it&#39;&#39;s too dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dangerous?! You clearly haven&#39;&#39;t been paying attention then. Dangerous doesn&#39;&#39;t scare me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;&#39;s not about you being scared, and I know you&#39;&#39;re capable of defending yourself, but against a lycan? Against many lycans? I would rather you stay safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah, you can&#39;&#39;t keep me here. I&#39;&#39;m going whether you like it or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vera, this is not negotiable, you have to st-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has toe with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all turn to Elden who had been staying quiet for most of this conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Did you miss the part where she literally has magical powers? Who knows how useful she could be,&#34; He says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean herbat skills are great, sure, but I wouldn&#39;&#39;t say they&#39;&#39;re *magical powers*&#34; Eli</p>
                
                
                
                <p>retorts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all turn to him now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you missed that part of the story too, didn&#39;&#39;t you?&#34; Noah says and I roll my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I proceed to tell Eli everything about my being a half witch, too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I&#39;&#39;m done, he&#39;&#39;s gaping at me. Full on, open mouth, frozen expression. Then, something clicks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;&#39;re ok with this?!&#34; He yells at Noah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah simply shrugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clearly, I am,&#34; he says and signals to his mark on my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eli looks back and forth between the mark, Noah, and myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me that&#39;&#39;s not what I think it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah snorts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What else could it be, old man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;&#39;s a moment of awkward silence while Eli figures out how to feel about this. He already had a problem with Noah being mated to a wolf, but now that wolf is also half witch. I&#39;&#39;m sure if he concentrates on it enough, his head will implode. Heposes himself and the stern expression is back. He gets up from the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I take it we are all on board with the n then. I will make the due arrangements, quickly, before the Kinges back. We&#39;&#39;ll be in touch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, Eli leaves the cabin without saying anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elden also gets up and leaves without saying a single word, even though based on his silence and expression I can tell he has a lot in his mind. Noah and I are left in the cabin alone with our thoughts and little by little, the reality of the situation settles in.</p>
