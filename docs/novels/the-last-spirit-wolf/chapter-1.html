                <p>entire waterfall appears to be made of pure jade. Its gentle fall of water also makes this the perfect</p>

                <p>everything around me still and a chill runs down my spine. My eyes frantically scan the surroundings,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>from tree to tree, from nt to nt. The forest is trying to tell me something is wrong and rm bells</p>

                <p>Well, ‘morning to you, too- I interrupt her before she can continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need scouts by the Jade Waterfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vera, what’s wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don’t know yet, but –</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, I know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not ten minutester about twenty-five scouts are joining me, feeling the same tension in the air I do</p>
                
                
                
                <p>when they approach. Our Alpha arrives shortly after, apanied by her mate in wolf form. We are all</p>
                
                
                
                <p>feeling uneasy, but none more so than I. Even in human form, no one is more attuned to the forest than</p>
                
                
                
                <p>me. Our Alpha speaks first,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Whatever this is, it isn’t only affecting Vera. Everyone, gather in pairs and search the forest starting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>from the north side. Keep me informed.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scouts do as they’re told, rushing into the forest with a howl. Our Alpha turns to me,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You should head back with us, Vera. You have an important day ahead of you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“If you don’t mind, Alpha -” She grunts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“If you don’t mind… Sofia… I’m going to stay here a little longer. Maybe I can help.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sofia, our Alpha, is the daughter of the previous Alpha and my best friend. We’ve known each other</p>
                
                
                
                <p>since we were young and know everything about each other, but now that she is our Alpha, this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>knowledge feels a little intrusive. It doesn’t even feel proper to call her by her name anymore. She</p>
                
                
                
                <p>gives me a worried look,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please be safe, you may be one of the best warriors we have, but you still can’t shift. Whatever is out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>there, is strong enough for us all to be uneasy.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lower my head at this and she sighs. The fact that I have not yet been able to shift has been a great</p>
                
                
                
                <p>concern of mine. Any decent wolf can transform by the age of 12. I’m 23 and still can’t connect with my</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wolf; sometimes it makes me wonder if I’m a werewolf at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I notice Sofia trying to waddle her way onto her husband’s back. She hates riding him like this, but in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her very pregnant state, he has given her no choice. I help her climb on top and he gently stands,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>bowing his head my way in a silent ‘thank you’. Sofia squeezes my hand before letting go and taking off</p>
                
                
                
                <p>with her mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they’re out of sight, I take my shoes off and crouch on the ground, putting both my hands deep in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the soil. I take a deep breath, and begin. Goosebumps rise all over my body as I connect to the forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind has once again begun to blow, easing the stuffiness that was there before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clear my mind and focus only on my senses; how humid the air I breathe feels, how my hair blows at</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the wind’s whim, how all the hairs on my body are standing to attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>5 minutes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>15 minutes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>30 minutes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite my best efforts, I sense nothing. It seems that whatever was there is gone along with the eerie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>feeling. With a sigh, I take my shoes in my hand and begin walking barefoot through the forest, heading</p>
                
                
                
                <p>back to the pack house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I near the edge of the forest with the pack house in sight, the wind begins to blow on my back and I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>stop in my tracks. I don’t even have to turn around to sense it. I lift my face to sniff the air and it’s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It smells like blood. A lot of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jogged back to the pack house and back to my room. The smell of blood was intense, but there was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>no way of telling who’s it was or where it wasing from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quick, hot shower, I change into my scrubs and grab my duffel bag for the day. Heading down to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the pack clinic, I skip breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I enter the clinic on edge, as if anything could happen at any moment. I’m starting to feel a little</p>
                
                
                
                <p>paranoid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey, Violet? Do we have any iings?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Violet, our head nurse, gives me a puzzled look as she double checks our charts. I notice her usually</p>
                
                
                
                <p>long dark curls have been straightened, and her mascara frames her blue eyes perfectly. She’s in her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>forties and an exceptionally beautiful woman with glowing dark skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No doc, we have a quiet day ahead so far.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can’t help but give everything in the ER a quick look, just to ease my nerves. This uneasiness seems</p>
                
                
                
                <p>unshakeable, it’s almost as if I carried the scent of blood with me from the forest; I’m smelling it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I’m just on edge because it is a big day, a life changing day, for me. Today is Dr. Owen’s</p>

                <p>Our pack has the biggest poption of wolves from all the primary packs in the country, it’s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>understandable considering we guard the south border with lycan territory. Werewolves and lycans</p>

                <p>species were constantly at war; for territory, for mates, for food sources, for… fun? Lycans are</p>
                
                
                
                <p>notoriouslybative creatures, even amongst themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clinic oversees all of the wolf poption in our pack, and as the Head Physician, I will have to</p>

                <p>I proceed to make my usual rounds for the rest of the morning, all in preparation for the party. Dr.</p>

                <p>special day for him. He took me in as an apprentice when no one saw any potential in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was only 12 years old but I was already learning all the basics of surgery; Despite my young age, I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>had the stomach for it. I graduated early from high school and managed to get straight into med school</p>
                
                
                
                <p>where I graduated top of my ss. Yet here I was facing this new challenge, feeling anxious as heck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s past five o’clock and everything has been rather quiet. I’m ready to pass on my patients to the next</p>

                <p>Before I can ask her anything, I hear themotion outside. A badly injured werewolfes barging</p>
                
                
                
                <p>in through the E.R door, holding an unconscious wolf. I rush to them and the nurses that were already</p>

                <p>“Vera, take Eric. Violet, prep the defibritor. Erica and Sam, prep an O.R.” The urgency in his voice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>can’t be missed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I start checking the vitals on Eric. Wasn’t he one of the scouts today? In fact, weren’t both of them</p>
                
                
                
                <p>scouting? He seems to have a concussion and his entire body is trembling in shock. We have to check</p>

                <p>The feeling of dread I’d been carrying with me all dayes back full force as Sofia mind links me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>again,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vera, we’re going to need all hands on deck. Get your people ready. Ten injured wolves total, three</p>

                <p>Lycans?! Did you just say lycans?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amongst the eight more wolves that show up with minor to severe injuries within the next five minutes, I</p>

                <p>to have mild injuries, notoriously scratch marks. What the hell happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn my full attention to the severely injured lycan and for a moment, it’s as if I can feel his slowing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>heart beat in my own chest. I check his vitals as a nurse reluctantly hooks him to all the machines. As I</p>

                <p>Without warning, his eyes shoot open startling me and sending both our heart rates through the roof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks at me intently; I would never think those eyes are of a man who is barely alive.</p>

                <p>my head is reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he just whisper… mate?</p>
