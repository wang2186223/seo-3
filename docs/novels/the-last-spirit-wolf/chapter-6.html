                <p>strange as it might sound, this is the one ce where I’ve never felt alone. Even as a child, I thought</p>
                
                
                
                <p>about running away to the forest countless times. If not for Sofia and her family, I probably would have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I climb up the stairs that lead to Sofia’s office. This is where she spends most of her time. I knock, and</p>

                <p>Alex beckons me to sit on one of the chairs facing the chimney, for which I’m grateful, I still feel cold</p>
                
                
                
                <p>from my vision. He sits in the chair next to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She’s getting closer to her due date.” He muses while looking at the vivid me. I just turn to him,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>expecting him to continue. “I don’t know how we’re going to do this, Vera. After her father passed away,</p>

                <p>interim position, and look at us now.” He turns to look at me with sad eyes. “She barely sleeps as it is,</p>

                <p>her if we were attacked. A knot forms in my throat.</p>

                <p>yesterday, I’ve been feeling uneasy, you guys know that. But today…” Alex doesn’t fully know the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>extent of my abilities, only that my instincts are never wrong. “Something ising Alex. Something we</p>
                
                
                
                <p>are not prepared for.” He gives me a long look, but before he can press me for information, we feel</p>

                <p>pained look. I can tell all of this is weighing heavily on him. Sofia goes to sit at her desk. I join her,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sitting across from her. Her desk isrge and bulky, fully made of wood, and goes back generations. Its</p>

                <p>My best friend is one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever met. She has straight, light brown hair</p>
                
                
                
                <p>cascading to her lower back and honey gold eyes. Her slender figure makes her appear younger and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fragile, but she is one of the fiercest warriors in our entire pack. What shecks in brute strength, she</p>

                <p>her position as Alpha was made permanent. People in fact cheered that once again, someone in the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allen family was going to be our Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“If your vision was as bad as you look, I’m already concerned.” She has on that neutral expression I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>recognize to mean business. I tell her everything I saw without sparing any details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I’m done, there is a long silence as Sofia stares at the fire to her left. The floor to ceiling window</p>

                <p>“In your vision, was the creature on lycan territory?” I’m not sure where she’s going with this but I nod. I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>never saw it cross into ournd. She continues, “it’s after the lycans, Vera. Eric told me once they</p>

                <p>her next words carefully. “This smells like magic, V. Very strong and dark magic. Whoever was directing</p>

                <p>“Sofia, listen to yourself, he’s a lycan!” I get up from my seat, exasperated that I even have to exin it.</p>
