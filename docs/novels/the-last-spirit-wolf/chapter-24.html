                <p>Chapter24</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open the door and Noah isying on my bed, facing the ceiling and fast asleep. He&#39;&#39;s breathing softly, carelessly. My heart warms at the sight. He&#39;&#39;s wearing new clothes, no doubt procured by the warriors who probably have his same build; dark blue jeans and a simple ck t-shirt. I had to admit, no one ever made simple look so good. Not wanting to wake him, I tip toe to my bathroom and notice it&#39;&#39;s been used. He probably used my shower and changed right here, waiting for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get the tub ready; a nice, hot bath with some healing herbs might be enough to ease the pain in my muscles. I don&#39;&#39;t heal as fast as the rest of the pack because I haven&#39;&#39;t connected to my wolf yet, so I&#39;&#39;ve always had to be extra careful. That&#39;&#39;s what turned me into a good fighter; while others were careless about their injuries knowing they&#39;&#39;d heal in a day&#39;&#39;s time, I had to be smarter and faster because I didn&#39;&#39;t have that same luxury. In fact, so many in training had been wounded to a point where it would be fatal to me. Training to them was just that, but to me, it was sometimes life and death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Starting the shower, I take a good bath first, scrubbing every inch of my body, ridding it of all the filth and dried blood that I have umted through the day. I had sters of blood, dirt, and goddess knows what else smeared all over me; my nose crinkling every time I had to be aggresive with the scrub to get rid of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I&#39;&#39;m done, I enter the bath and submerge. I sigh in contentment; this is exactly what I needed. I submerge everything but my face, being mindful of the stitches I have in my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take this time to meditate as usual, onlt this time I&#39;&#39;m tryong to focus on the visions or... dreams*... I had. They&#39;&#39;re more like a foggy memory now, and I can feel myself losing the memories of them as more time goes by. Maybe meditating on them, trying to recall them, will keep them fresh in my memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about 20 minutes of my breathing exercises, it is clear that my mind is too tired for this right now. I can&#39;&#39;t remember anything significant, only snippets of what I *maybe* saw. I know there is some great significance to this, but I can&#39;&#39;t bring the memories forward despite my best attempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting about 10 more minutes go by, I get out of the tub, towel myself dry, and get dressed in a red dress, traditional for wolf funeral ceremonies. It&#39;&#39;s a simple satin wrap dress with short sleeves, that reaches just below my mid-calf. I pause to look myself in the mirror, my fingertips. going to my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look pretty banged up. The still swollen stitches on my forehead do very little for myplexion, as I look like a sick mid-century orphan. My dark circles are more prominent than before, even if I did just wake up from a very long sleep. How long was I asleep for, anyway?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly fix my hair, brushing though all the knots and tangled mess. It looks half decent when I&#39;&#39;m done, at least its back to being straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I contemte putting on makeup to disguise how bad I feel on the inside, but choose not to. This isn&#39;&#39;t a time to pretend to not feel like shit. All of the pack feels like shit too, just like me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I open the bathroom door, Noah is still asleep and I consider leaving him here for the entire ceremony. He&#39;&#39;s been through a lot already just these past few weeks, I&#39;&#39;m sure he needs the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I&#39;&#39;m looking at him and weighing my options, the ceremonial horn blows off in the distance, signaling that the Pyre Ceremony has begun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah jolts up from the bed and is quick on his feet, his eyes are a tired red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wha-what&#39;&#39;s that?&#34; He&#39;&#39;s frantically trying to put his shoes on, &#34;Another attack? Vera, where-&#34; his eyesnd on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stay like this for a while, him staring at me. I can see the veins on his neck rapidly pumping blood; his jaw drops to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow...&#34; He finally manages when heposes himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile gently enjoying the overtpliment, but then again, he&#39;&#39;s my mate, he&#39;&#39;s not the best judge on how I actually look.Contentt bel0ngs to N0ve/lDra/ma.O(r)g!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a few steps, I reach the middle of the room and extend my hand towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, we have a ceremony to get to. Don&#39;&#39;t bother with the shoes, you won&#39;&#39;t need them.&#34; Indeed, all of our ceremonies are done without any shoes on, connecting directly to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He takes my hand and pulls me towards him, embracing me gently but securely. I take a deep breathe, inhaling his scent andmitting this feeling to memory. He smells like the forest. which doesn&#39;&#39;t make sense; no one should smell like the forest itself. &#34;I&#39;&#39;m so sorry, Vera. For everything. If we hadn&#39;&#39;te here, this would have never happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hug him a little tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None of this is your fault, Noah. Not yours, not Eli&#39;&#39;s, not Lucas&#39;&#39;s. Those wolves died with honor, defending their own. That is what this ceremony is about, not cing me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I meant every word. None of the other wolves in the pack thought any different. The fact was, if that thing was out there there was no guarantee that it wouldn&#39;&#39;t eventuallye for us, too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stay like this for a while, both of us drawingfort from each other and then, hand in hand, we walk out of the pack house, into the open field towards the pyre.</p>
