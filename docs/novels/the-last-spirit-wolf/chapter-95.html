                <p>Chapter95</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heartbeat I felt as my own, the feeling of uneasiness and foreboding... wasn&#39;&#39;t mine at all. It was Lucas. Another perk of being part witch; I can sometimes feel other people&#39;&#39;s emotions. especially people I care about. Nobody seems to realize what&#39;&#39;s happening right now, but I do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Violet is his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this time, his feeling of uneasiness was in fact because his mate was close, but he was fighting his instinct to look for her because of his fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;&#39;re both staring at each other with equal ambivalence; they don&#39;&#39;t move an inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Violet, exin yourself!&#34; One of the uncles shouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young Lady!&#34; Another one says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing seems to snap her out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas takes a step forward,pletely enthralled by the sight of his mate. I step to the side, blocking his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as I&#39;&#39;m happy Lucas has found his mate, and it happens to be *my* mate&#39;&#39;s supposed future wife, this is a very vtile situation, and numbers are definitely not on our side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cecil moves towards her daughter, putting her hand gently on her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daughter, don&#39;&#39;t be afraid, you can speak freely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This seems to break Violet&#39;&#39;s trance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhm... I... Uhm... What?&#34; She stutters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You told me you were worried about the King being illst night, so you wanted to bring him some tea to his room, is that right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, yes of course,&#34; Violet says, still looking directly at Lucas and no one else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucas,&#34; I whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; he responds, not paying any attention to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Snap out of it!&#34; I say, pushing him discreetly towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;&#39;s going on?&#34; Caleb follows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Violet is Lucas&#39;&#39;s mate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb stops, wide eyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Goddess. This whole trip just keeps getting worse! Come on, kid. Walk with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb helps me shove Lucas towards the door, cautious that nobody sees us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah has caught on and is giving me a quizzical look, while everyone else is focused on Violet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mate.&#34; I mouth, and Noah&#39;&#39;s eyes go wide, looking between Lucas and Violet quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see him mouth &#39;&#39;f**k&#39;&#39; once he realizes what&#39;&#39;s going on; we&#39;&#39;re lucky nobody has noticed our interaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she in fact enter your bedroom, Your Majesty?!&#34; One of the voices demands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;&#39;t know, I wasn&#39;&#39;t there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, it&#39;&#39;s true?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exin yourself, Your Majesty!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the voices are jumbled together as we finally step out of the room with Lucas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok. Here&#39;&#39;s the thing, kid. If she&#39;&#39;s your mate, it can&#39;&#39;t happen like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If?&#34; Lucas looks offended, &#34;how can she *not* be my mate? She perfect! She smells of cinnamon and roses and ... and... dessert! She&#39;&#39;s incredible,&#34; he trails off, sidestepping us to try and enter the room again. &#34;Yes! Ok! She&#39;&#39;s your mate, but you have to understand, she&#39;&#39;s not just any lycan! This has to be done politically!&#34; Caleb pleads with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nonsense!&#34; He says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucas, please think about this! We will make sure you two are together, I promise, but right now, Violet is suspected to have been in Noah&#39;&#39;s room! If you know what that means, you know how delicate this is.&#34; Realization crosses his face, quickly followed by anger. His lycan eyes begin to swirl in his pupils instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Lucas, listen to me,&#34; I step in front of him, blocking his way, &#34;It&#39;&#39;s not true! Noah was with me the entire night!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;&#39;t care! I will kill him!&#34; He shouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, Goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never knew this mate thing could be so intense. When I met Noah, he was half dead. I wonder if he would have been this intense had he been healthy and awake.  A fist flies in front of my face, taking me by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb just punched Lucas, right across his cheek. Hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get your shit together, kid! Did you not hear Vera? Noah has not touched your mate! Now, stay calm, and stay away until we can sort this mess out!&#34; He&#39;&#39;s speaking in a low, stern voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas&#39;&#39;s eyes go back to normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure he hasn&#39;&#39;t touched her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raise an eyebrow at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I&#39;&#39;m surprised you would even *think* him capable of that considering he has a mate,&#34; I narrow my eyes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, yeah. Yeah, of course you&#39;&#39;re right. I just... I&#39;&#39;ve never felt anything like this before. It&#39;&#39;s like I can&#39;&#39;t breathe but at the same time, like I&#39;&#39;m breathing clean air for the first time. It doesn&#39;&#39;t make sense.&#34; &#34;No, no it doesn&#39;&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pat his back gently, letting him calm down before taking him out of the manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, the doors open and Eli emerges from behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;&#39;s getting nasty in there,&#34; he says, his voice grave.Content ? provided by N?velDrama.Org.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately go to him, nodding at Caleb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got him, don&#39;&#39;t worry,&#34; he says, seeing Lucas out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that about?&#34; Eli asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Violet is Lucas&#39;&#39;s mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eli stops right before entering the dining room, his expression one of disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, let&#39;&#39;s save that bombshell for some other time, you have to get in there. I know we said that it would be a bad idea for you to fight her, but...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to marry our niece, Your Highness! What kind of King would defile a youngdy and not be made responsible for her?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are an honor-less King!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fake King Noah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your father would be ashamed of you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I enter the room, all of the men have started surrounding Noah, who is holding up his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What makes you think I touched her?&#34; He says trying to defend himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Obviously she fainted at the memory!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you not see her, Your Highness, are you blind?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why else would she copse if not out of embarrassment!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I search for Violet in the crowd. She has indeed copsed and her mother is holding her in her arms as some maids fan her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quick, get her some water!&#34; Cecil yells.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the maids quickly gets up and goes into the corridor that leads to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fake King Noah!&#34; The men are chanting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step forward, Eli close behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch how you speak to your King! Unless you can prove that he had his way with Lady Violet,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suggest you keep your mouth shut! Or would you anger the true King of the lycans?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;m livid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vera is correct, indeed,&#34; William says, &#34;tradition states that a test must be conducted to see if Lady Violet is still... untouched.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost puke in my mouth as he says that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will not allow my daughter to be humiliated in this way!&#34; Cecil shouts, handing her daughter to one of the maids to tend to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cousin, it is the way it is, you know better than to stand in the way of tradition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tradition?! You speak to me about tradition while this whore freely entertains the King! A Wolf! She points to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately turn to Noah, feeling his aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, Eli and I have felt it before, so we are not taken aback. But the rest of the people in here take several steps away from him in fear, unsure of what&#39;&#39;s going on. His lycan eyes are swirling in his pupils, and this is the very moment where everything can go to hell. Instead of creating a bridge between the Castle and the families, we will end whatever semnce of a rtionship that still exists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To hell with it. If tradition is so important to them, lets do this by the books.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I challenge Violet to a duel for Noah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turns to look at me following a deafening silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A wolf would defy a lycan?!&#34; Someone says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not a wolf, the King&#39;&#39;s mate. From what I understand, if Violet wins, she gets to marry Noah, If</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I win, she abandons all notions of ever bing Queen.&#34; I say, confidently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn to Noah now. Instead of looking murderous like he did a few seconds ago, he looks amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look back at Cecil and she&#39;&#39;s smirking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well, I ept the challenge on Violet&#39;&#39;s behalf. Once she is well, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; I repeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This seems to please everyone has they all have nasty smiles on their faces. Quickly, everyone begins dispersing, content with the oue of this little ruse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Violet has begun to wake up and is taken to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the room ispletely empty and it&#39;&#39;s just us in here, Elies to stand next to me, smirking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;&#39;s about time they learned to respect our true Queen.&#34;</p>
