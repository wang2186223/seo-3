                <p>It takes me a couple of seconds to react. Did I hear him correctly? Did he say mate?! One of the lycans</p>

                <p>“Come on, Noah…e on, man.” He seems to be tearing up when suddenly,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beep. Beep. Beep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s faint, but it’s there. This is good enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Let’s roll him up to an O.R!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, this is one of those moments where I re-evaluate my entire life so far. Here I am scrubbed in to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>operate on a lycan. Did I mention I know nothing of lycan anatomy? I’m going off on the assumption</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that it is essentially werewolf anatomy, but different. How different? We’re about to find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I make the first incision and as I suspected, one of his lungs has copsed. I insert a chest tube to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>stabilize the lung and head for the next injury. Dr. Owens enters the OR, scrubbed in to help me. He</p>
                
                
                
                <p>smiles gently andes to stand in front of me, assessing my work so far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What are we working with?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Copsed lung, internal bleeding, more broken bones than I care to count right now, and half of his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ribs are broken. I’m honestly surprised he’s still alive.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well, lycans are very resilient creatures. I’ll start on the bones, if we let them heal incorrectly, we’ll just</p>
                
                
                
                <p>have to break themter to correct them, let’s take advantage now that he’s under. Did you put him on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>blood thinners?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn’t even think to do that. Normally we don’t have to use blood thinners when operating on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>werewolves. He notices my frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lycans heal much faster than wolves, if we don’t put them on blood thinners, the incisions you make</p>
                
                
                
                <p>will heal before you can properly fix him.” It’s hard to believe he can heal at all considering the state</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he’s in, but we proceed as instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We continue the rest of the surgery with ease and we are relieved to learn that Jason, Dr. Owens&#39;&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>patient, will make a full recovery. He was the wolf in by far the worst condition. With my mentor here,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>everyone seems more confident. He starts humming quietly to himself as he works on the fractures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Owens knows more about lycans than I imagined, it is evident as he works on the patient’s bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exins in detail how to treat every fracture and how lycans have some different bone structures to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wolves. It seems logical considering how different our beast forms are.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we finish the surgery, his vitals are stable and I’m quite happy with how everything turned out. Dr.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Owens will run additional x-rays to see any further damage to his bones that will require fixing, but</p>
                
                
                
                <p>overall, he’s doing a lot better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He’s rolled out of surgery and I head into the changing rooms for a well-deserved shower. I put on my</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ck leggings, a bralette and my favorite baggy sweater. It’s almost ten o’clock and I am more than</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ready for thefort of my bed. I am wiped out from not sleeping properly these past few weeks, but</p>
                
                
                
                <p>first I have to check on my patients. Particrly the one I just spent hours on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I enter the room and a nurse, Katie, is updating his chart. The room is dimly lit by one of the bedside</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He likes it dark,”es an almost growl from a figure in the corner of the room. He’s sitting down but I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>can smell him, he’s one of the lycans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie gives me an annoyed look, letting me know she tried it too. Well, I am not Katie. I turn it on with a</p>

                <p>flick of the wrist. This inspires a growl from the friend in the corner but Katie is relieved that she can</p>
                
                
                
                <p>actually do her job now. She hurries and finishes her notes, checks his meds and leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room the lycans are in has four beds; one of them has been left empty as I imagine no wolf wanted</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to be in here with them; in the one next to my patient is the young lycan from earlier, apparently</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sedated. The one in the corner starts moving when I approach the bed of his friend. He looks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>noticeably older than the other two. I proceed to check my patient with him looming over us; it’s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>incredibly annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I’m done, I turn to him. One of his arms is on an arm sling and the other is heavily and incorrectly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>bandaged; I frown at this, did someone from our staff do this? It seems like negligent care. I also notice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he has a deep cut across his forehead that is nearly healed and a scratch mark on his neck that is still</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a vivid red color. It is no wonder he copsed when they came in. He has deep grey eyes, whiting hair,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and a muscr build that betrays his likely age. His face is stern and his eyes are distant. Much like the</p>
