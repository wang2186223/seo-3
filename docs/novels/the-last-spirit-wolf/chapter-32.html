                <p>Chapter32</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Noah-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire room has turned into a fit of mumbled whispers. I can swear I even heard a gasp. My statement hangs in the air, creating more and more doubt to our story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I assume you brought us some proof of such *fantastical* im, Warrior Noah?&#34; The King says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The expression on his face confuses me; I saw emotions there, but not surprise. I narrow my eyes at this, could he have heard of it before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eli reaches into his bag, retrieving a very long w. Sofia had given us pieces of the creature to present during our trial, even photos, all of which we present to the Council and the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each takes their time to examine the evidence. The photos, the pieces of hair, the ws and teeth. They pass around the evidence, some eyeing it with curiosity and others barely looking at them. It seems some of the people here had already made up their minds before we even showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As interesting as all of these objects are,&#34; one of the council members speaks first, &#34;I do not think it is evidence enough. This is a creature of folk tales only. All of this could&#39;&#39;ve been fabricated for all we know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chatter ensues. Council Member William speaks,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Council Member Micah, it is known that these creatures were used by powerful witches and warlocks during the Age of Witches. Do not be so quick to condemn our warriors who bravely brought us proof, because if what they tell us is true, we have far bigger problems on our hands.&#34;Material ? N?velDrama.Org.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Witches! Warlocks! Listen to yourself! You are so quick to forgive these deserters when they have brought us no real proof of a witch, or a warlock!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, what else do you think a chimeraes from? Nature?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room once again bes riled up with council members fighting to speak over each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had be so invested in the Council Members that I hadn&#39;&#39;t noticed Vera had moved. In fact, no one had noticed Vera had moved. I turn my head, looking for her, drawing the King&#39;&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had moved to where our bags and her spear were, temporarily out of the Council&#39;&#39;s sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she returned, everyone was already aware of her movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came back holding something in her hand, I couldn&#39;&#39;t tell what, and her spear. She returned to stand next to me, looking at Council Member William directly, &#34;May I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Council Member William merely nods, dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;m not going to lie; Vera could get us all killed right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I start sweating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She calmly walks closer to the council members, some having to lean over their seats to see what she ces on the floor. It&#39;&#39;s some form of crystal, but it&#39;&#39;s slightly broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is your proof,&#34; she says calmy, and she proceeds raise the spear and smash the crystal with great strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel a wave of force crash into me, it&#39;&#39;s unlike anything I have experienced before and it is apanied by a blinding light. Dust has been elevated by the force and is now hanging all</p>
                
                
                
                <p>over us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I can open my eyes again, Vera is by my side, with the spear safely sheathed on her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the dust settles the rest of the Council open their eyes, they stare at her, wide eyed, some with their jaws ajar. The crystal now haspletely shattered on the floor in front of the council members. &#34;This... this still doe...doesn&#39;&#39;t...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Shut up!&#34; Council Member William interrupts Council Member Micah. &#34;We all felt that. didn&#39;&#39;t we?! *This was the proof you requested, and you got it. This trial is over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Council Members look up to the King, who is sitting passively and looking at Vera. He looks at her so long that I&#39;&#39;m beginning to get ufortable. She&#39;&#39;s doesn&#39;&#39;t look at him, she looks straight ahead. &#34;The trial is indeed over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>King Alistair gets up from his seat and leaves the room, signaling that the trial is over. The council members slowly follow suit, some eyeing us with disgust, others with curiosity. Council Member William has a small smile on his face as he regards us. I am d we found ourselves an unlikely ally in this situation, otherwise, we wouldn&#39;&#39;t have survived this trial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We would live to see another day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now.</p>
