                <p>Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dinner ended soon after Violet left. Eli joined us at the head of the table and excused himself, having offered to take up Lucas&#39;&#39;s ce in the night guard shift so that he can have something to eat. This earned Cecil an angry look from Noah, which was her cue to call it a night. She excused herself to run after her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The problem was, however, that she took Noah with her, offering to see him to his room. He epted and followed her; I&#39;&#39;m assuming he&#39;&#39;s still mad at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed and excused myself with the rest of the guests, some of which were too drunk to make it to their rooms so I have reason to believe they&#39;&#39;ll sleep in here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walk out of the manor, this time without an escort, I take my shoes off and instead of going directly to the cabin, I decide to sit in the garden for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These past months I have also been training with my aunt and grandmother in their realm; we have found out that in my world my magic can be traced, but in their realm it&#39;&#39;s nearly impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I find a patch of grass to sit on and cross my legs as I sit. The temperature is nice, the wind carries a chill with it that hints at how close we are to the mountains. I put my hands on the soil, reveling on the connection I feel to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During my training, we have figured out that I am innately connected to nature. We don&#39;&#39;t really know why as it&#39;&#39;s quite rare for any type of witch, but to me it makes sense; everything in nature is living, and that&#39;&#39;s what I&#39;&#39;m connecting to. To me the trees, the nts, the soil are as alive as any of us and somehow, we manage tomunicate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What&#39;&#39;s even weirder, is that I have been feeling this connection since before they unlocked my magic; so, since before I had my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speaking of her, as I&#39;&#39;m concentrating and meditating, shees join me in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Hi, pretty girl.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile at her as sheys her head on myp. I gently caress her head as we both take in our surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She does in fact have white, grey eyes, and her fur is just as Caleb described it; iridescent. It&#39;&#39;s pale white but it shifts in tone frequently, depending on the angle and the light. Now that I have been able to see her up close, it&#39;&#39;s almost as if she shines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel bad that I haven&#39;&#39;t been able to let her out in a while. Even if she seems perfectly content within me, she is also a living creature; part of me but an individual in her own right. She deserves to roam freely, often. So far, she hasn&#39;&#39;t even been able to fully explore her magic since we haven&#39;&#39;t been able to practice in my world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She perks up, alerting me to something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pay closer attention to the direction she&#39;&#39;s looking. She slowly moves her head to a side, as if she&#39;&#39;s following something or someone. *What is it?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turns to me and ces her nose to mine, letting me in on what she sees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond the garden, beyond the walls of the manor, she&#39;&#39;s following a shiny silhouette that seems to be of a woman, right behind the vines. *Who is she?* I ask her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, all I know is that she seems to be interested in this silhouette for some reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, the person disappears and we can no longer track her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stay seated next to my wolf who turns to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Sophia, I know I should have a fluent connection to my wolf, understand everything she means without her even talking, but for some reason I can&#39;&#39;t. There&#39;&#39;s a lot of interpretation going on every time I see her, but I know nothing for sure. She ces her head back on myp and I caress her for a while longer. Then, her ears perk up again but this time it&#39;&#39;s something outside of my mind, something in the &#39;&#39;real world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. Lucas! Hi.&#34; I say, opening my eyes and rxing my posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Vera, I thought I smelled you. What are you doing out here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I needed time away from all of this,&#34; I gesture at the manor, &#34;I think I made a mistake bying here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we all made a mistake bying here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hees to sit beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;&#39;t get to thank you for taking my ce at the barn, Lucas, it can&#39;&#39;t befortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;&#39;t be thanking me tomorrow when Eli&#39;&#39;s snores keep you up all night,&#34; he says, taking a bite off of a piece of bread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stay silent for a while, enjoying the cool air and the garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vera, how did you know Noah was your mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know it was him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His question takes me by surprise, but I think back to the day we met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;&#39;t really know, Lucas, I just knew that when I touched him, something happened. Had it not been for him literally telling me I was his mate, I wouldn&#39;&#39;t have known.&#34; &#34;And then what happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I don&#39;&#39;t know that I&#39;&#39;m the most reliable source, since I hadn&#39;&#39;t connected to my wolf, but there was... electricity... when I touched him, maybe not as strong as he felt it, but it was there. And I was just... drawn to him... naturally. I wanted to know him, I wanted to follow him. It wanted to be with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas finishes his piece of bread but stays silent.Content ? provided by N?velDrama.Org.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you ask?&#34; I ask, letting my curiosity get the best of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was meaning to ask Noah, but he&#39;&#39;s been so busytely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? No! No, it&#39;&#39;s not like that. I&#39;&#39;ve just been feeling a little queasy for some reason. It started</p>
                
                
                
                <p>on our way here, I haven&#39;&#39;t figured out what it is and it&#39;&#39;s making me uneasy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think your mate could be close?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;&#39;t know...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Lucas, you can talk to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just... I don&#39;&#39;t know... Do I even want to find a mate? You saw what happened to Liam... That could happen to any of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;&#39;s a scary thing. Lucas, and what happened to Liam was brutal, but it&#39;&#39;s so rare. It&#39;&#39;s unlikely that we&#39;&#39;ll ever see that happen again. And look at me, I had to leave my *home* to be with Noah and I have not regret it once,&#34; well, maybe at first, but a white lie can&#39;&#39;t hurt, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;&#39;re probably right. I just... I hope if she is indeed close, that she won&#39;&#39;t be disappointed that I&#39;&#39;m her mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my hand on his and squeeze it gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucas, you&#39;&#39;re one of the best people I know. You&#39;&#39;re loyal, caring, and quite a gentleman. Any girl would be lucky to have you as her mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiles faintly at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, V.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stay out here a little while longer, until the chill starts to really get really cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should go, from what Eli told me, we&#39;&#39;ll be leaving pretty early tomorrow, we&#39;&#39;ll need the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas extends his hand and offers it to me, helping me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take it and we begin walking to the cabin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once at the door, he says his goodbyes and leaves for the barn; I really hope it&#39;&#39;s at least warm enough for him to sleep well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I enter my room, a lot more exhausted that I&#39;&#39;d thought, and change into my pajamas. Unfortunately, since I&#39;&#39;m sharing the cabin with Caleb and Eli, I have to wear pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fall asleep promptly, wrapping myself up in the nket that has probably beenying on this bed for years. It&#39;&#39;s still cold, butfortable enough to sleep through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the middle of the night, something wakes me; the feeling of someone crawling on my bed.</p>
