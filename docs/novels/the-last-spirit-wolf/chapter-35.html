                <p>Chapter35</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, I wake up at the crack of dawn and Noah is already gone. There&#39;&#39;s a note on my nightstand, *Vera*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What&#39;&#39;s mine is yours, please feel free to anything you&#39;&#39;d like. I&#39;&#39;ll see youter.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take my time to shower, letting the warm water ease my troubled mind. Despite how much I keep trying to make it make sense, the King&#39;&#39;s actions still don&#39;&#39;t sit right with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wash my hair, reveling on the scalp massage. The shampoo Noah has smells like peppermint, it helps me rx. I take my time in scrubbing my body too, washing away all the dirt from the past couple of days. Once I&#39;&#39;m done, I towel myself dry. I look in the mirror and at least I look well rested now. The dark circles under my eyes have faded and my eyes are back to looking normal; light, light green. There&#39;&#39;s a knock on the door, It&#39;&#39;s Lucas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open the door and he&#39;&#39;s wearing a big smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Vera, good morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Lucas.&#34; I return his smile, it&#39;&#39;s quite infectious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; he says as I close the door, &#34;you already know your way to the kitchen, we&#39;&#39;ll be making our way there for breakfast a littleter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are we avoiding the other lycans?&#34; I was wondering the same thingst night but I thought perhaps he was just being polite and letting me rest; today it&#39;&#39;s a little more evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitates, his smile falling. I keep looking at him patiently. I don&#39;&#39;t need things sugar coated for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah told me not to tell you anything, so don&#39;&#39;t tell him I told you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitates again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can trust me, Lucas. It&#39;&#39;ll be our little secret.&#34; I wink at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He eases up a bit, but his smile doesn&#39;&#39;t return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;&#39;re an unmarked female, Vera. I don&#39;&#39;t feelfortable taking you to where other male lycans are, they don&#39;&#39;t respect me like they do Noah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I have a fated mate, isn&#39;&#39;t that enough for them to stay away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That only happens with wolves, from what I gathered. Unmated lycans don&#39;&#39;t care if you have a fated mate or not. That&#39;&#39;s why Noah has instructed us to escort you every time you want to go out of your room.&#34; We keep walking in silence, why wouldn&#39;&#39;t Noah want me to know this? It seems like crucial information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We make it to themon area, filled with games, a giant T.V and several pool tables. It&#39;&#39;s empty. As Lucas informs me, this area is usually used at night when they aren&#39;&#39;t working or training.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next, he takes me to an outside patio. It has no trees, no flowers, no vegetation at all. It only has a big but dull fountain, and several concrete statues that give it a creepy feeling. It seems as cold as the rest of the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can take you to the gym and other training areaster on when it&#39;&#39;s unupied, I know you like to run. Just remember to let us know when you want to use it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words confirm what I have been feeling. I&#39;&#39;m in a prison. I can&#39;&#39;t move freely about, and I can&#39;&#39;t move at all without a chaperone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for showing me around Lucas. I really appreciate it but... is there like... a library here? Or a ce where lycans don&#39;&#39;t usually go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stays silent for a while, thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, I do think there is a library here. I&#39;&#39;ve never been but I think that&#39;&#39;s clear indication that nobody usually goes there. Come, I can show you after we eat something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We venture into the kitchen and dining hall; it is indeed empty except for a couple of females that eye us curiously when we sit. These are the first females I have seen since we got here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;&#39;t realize there were more females here.&#34;Contentt bel0ngs to N0ve/lDra/ma.O(r)g!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah,&#34; he tells me as we start eating, &#34;many lycans are mated. Some females are also lycan. others are humans. They usually keep to themselves. I&#39;&#39;ll introduce you to a couple that are mated to our friends.&#34; &#34;Friends? There are more other than you and Eli?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By this point we are done eating and I remind Lucas that he still has to show me the one and only ce in this entire castle that I care about, the library.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walk for about ten minutes, across many halls, many rooms, stair case after stair case, until we are on one of the top floors, with a clearer view of the snow-covered mountains outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrive to the doors leading to the library, I can tell this ce isn&#39;&#39;t visited very often. There is a musty air to the air and thickyers of dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lucas opens the door, my heart nearly stops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two doors reveal inside a massive library, unlike anything I have ever seen. Impressive ceiling high book shelves, with thousands, no... millions of books... line the entire space. I step inside, reveling in the discovery of a ce where I wouldn&#39;&#39;t feel like a prisoner, until from the corner of my eye I see a figure moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who dares enter my sanctuary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure is moving closer and closer to us, Lucas automaticallying in between it and myself to protect me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As it approaches and I can better appreciate it, I gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is that a Council Member robe?</p>
